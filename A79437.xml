            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>And truely, Sir, among good words, perverted from the right meaning, and abuſed to Reproach, none have been more than thoſe two which the Author of this ſmall Treatiſe hath dignified his Title-page with. A <hi>Catholick</hi> in our days is become as contemptible as a <hi>Puritan</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, or a <hi>Phanatick</hi> now; whenas every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is really a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and doth approve himſelf ſo in his Principles and Practice, is a Member of the Catholick Church, hopes to be ſaved by the common, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith; exerciſeth Catholick Holineſs in his life and converſation, holding a <hi>Catholick Communion</hi> with all <hi>viſible Catholicks.</hi> And this is the Chriſtian that is likelieſt to contribute moſt to the healing the manifold heart and Church-diviſions among us.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> it's well known how our Age hath delivered it up to the infamous uſage of ſcurrilous Tongues and Pens, notwithſtanding its venerable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-enough to be admired ſignificancy, that the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it calls for Reverence and Devotion; yea, its very letters and ſyllables will be a Monument of Renown, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all the deſignes of ill-minded men, to abandon the <hi>Churches glory,</hi> and to convert all <hi>Eceleſiaſtical Decency and Order</hi> into a confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> of phantaſtical Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or a <hi>miſcelany of private Humours and Intereſts.</hi> And do men know what <hi>Hierarchy</hi> is, that ſpeak ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently of it? is it not a <hi>Sacred Juriſdiction?</hi> and where is it ſeated and exerciſed? is it not in the Church and Conſcience, ſeats of its dominion ſo ſacred, that no Secular Power can aſpire unto, without the higheſt uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation? And there is no true <hi>Church</hi> and ſound <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> in which the Hierarchy doth not exert its power, and is not as freely ſubmitted unto with all due homage and obedience. And whatever ſome licentious Proteſtants may pretend to, and raiſe ſo much duſt of contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
<pb facs="tcp:135610:3"/>or of whatever Churches, of unquoth names and worſe natures, they profeſs themſelves Members; if ever they intend to be ſaved, they muſt (notwithſtanding all their <hi>religious Huffs</hi>) at laſt be found Members of the Catholick Church, and be ſubjected to the Catholick Hierarchy thereof: And till this profeſſed ſubjection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more univerſal among Chriſtians, Religion will ſtill be ſplitting on the Rocks of <hi>Faction, Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, you will finde the principal deſigne of thoſe few ſheets ſubmitted to your judgment, is to recommend this <hi>Panacaea,</hi> or <hi>Catholick Remedy,</hi> for the ſound healing of of our <hi>morbid Church,</hi> which ſeems to labour under ſome Diſeaſe not unlike the <hi>Microcoſmick Scorbet,</hi> being (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the account of late Phyſicians) a complication of all Diſtempers, or transforming it ſelf Symptomatically into the ſhapes of all diſeaſes of the <hi>Body natural.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, our Remedy being prepared, and applied <hi>S. Artem Spiritualem,</hi> may contribute towards the recovery of our thrice-honoured, but <hi>languiſhing Mother,</hi> more than all the <hi>eſſential or golden purging Spirit</hi> of <hi>Cochlear</hi> in <hi>London</hi> can do to the reſtoring of one Scorbutick body: neither is it prepared in every Elaboratory. He ſaith there is one at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> can do more towards it than any in <hi>England</hi> beſides. He tells me alſo of one admirable Vertue, that it doth wonderfully pacifie the diſquieted <hi>Archeus</hi> of a Body Politick; and if it be ſo, I will aſſure you it's to be preferred beyond all compare: for the plain truth of it is, the old Remedies of purging and bleeding do but ſcurvily agree with it, and it's very apt to Relapſes after thoſe rugged Medicines, as we finde by ſore experience.</p>
            <p>Sir, my Friend hath taken ſome pains, out of love to his Country, to clear up the nature, and demonſtrate the neceſſity of a <hi>Catholick Hierarchy;</hi> though you muſt
<pb facs="tcp:135610:4"/>not expect to finde that word often mentioned, the Vulgar being ſo apt to ſtart at it as a hard &amp; dangerous word, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant with a Pope. Sir, I had not obtained leave of my Friend to preſent theſe Papers to your view, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that I would apologize on his behalf, for the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Stile, ſaying, that he is naturally a ſtranger to the ſmooth dreſſes or high ſtrains of Rhetorick; &amp; indeed it's my judgment that the plain truth, eſpecially when it acts polemically, requires it not, but is uſually delighted in a garb moſt like it ſelf; and thereby is rendered moſt acceptable to every good man and ſolid judgment. He likewiſe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſires, that you will deliberately read, and not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cenſure any thing as diſſonant to truth, till you have duely weighed it in it ſelf, as in its dependencies and ſuppoſitions on which it is built.</p>
            <p>Sir, to conclude, I humbly crave pardon for the trouble I have given you, though I am fully ſatisfied the ſubject will not be unpleaſant to you, whom I know to be an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical <hi>Adeptus,</hi> In reſpect of your Catholick ſpirit, ſuperlative love to the Church, and ſingular devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Hierarchy. That you may long live, and continue in the ſame minde and practice, and many follow your worthy Example, is the devout Prayer of,</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Twofold Juriſdiction which a Chriſtian by the Law of Chriſt is ſubjected unto.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat there is ſuch a thing as Chriſtian Liberty, none pretending to a true information in the Doctrine of the Goſpel of Chriſt, I ſuppoſe, will deny; neither need I make it my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent task for to prove. But the great Conteſt for many Ages hath been, about the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Extent of this Liberty: Some ſtretching the bounds thereof larger than Chriſt ever did, intrenching on Civil and Moral Laws; opening thereby a gap to Licentiouſneſs, and the violation of the bonds of Humane Societies, in Magiſtratical Rule and Government. Others curtalizing and abridging the ſaid Liberty, not allowing it thoſe lawful extents allotted thereto by Chriſt; audaciouſly depriving his poor Members of many Goſpel-Priviledges and Advantages, granted them by Charter from the Supreme King and Lawgiver. Civil and Antichriſtian Powers ſtill making it their buſineſs to ſpy out this Liberty, and their great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to bring them into Bondage.</p>
            <p>§ 2. <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves, <hi>Duplex eſſe Regimen in Homine; alterum Spirituale, quo Conſcientia ad pietatem &amp; cultum divinum inſtituitur: alterum Politicum, quo ad Humanitatis &amp; Civilitatis officia, quae inter homines ſervanda ſunt, homo eruditur, Juriſdictio Spiritualis &amp; Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis.</hi> i. e. <hi>There is in Man a twofold Government; the one Spiritual, whereby the Conſcience is inſtructed unto Piety and the Worſhip of God: The other Political, whereby a man is taught the Duties of Humanity and Civility, which are to be obſerved between man and man, a ſpiritual Juriſdiction and a temporal.</hi> Which Obſervation hath Moral founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an Evangelical ratification; the whole of a Chriſtian being comprehended under theſe two Heads of Duty (charged upon us by the Old and New Teſtament,) towards God and towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. On the firſt of which Chriſt hath, by his peculiar Legiſlative Power over his Church, eſtabliſhed the whole Oeconomy thereof: On the latter he hath chiefly raiſed the edifices of Civil States and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135610:6"/>Societies, where he hath allowed a latitude of Legiſlative Power unto the Sons of men, as unto his Delegates and Subſtitutes in earthly Rule and Government. Unto both of theſe Juriſdictions he hath laid on man a firm Obligation, by planting his Moral Light in Conſcience; ſo that he cannot ſtart from either of theſe Duties, without ſtarting from himſelf, as our firſt Parents did in their Tranſgreſſion; and all others, in putting forth the poyſon of that original blot in actual ſins of Omiſſion or Commiſſion; all which are but irregularities, or nonconformities to this Moral obligation laid on Conſcience, either manifeſtly ſo, or eaſily reducible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. For whatever is a treſpaſs againſt the revealed Will of God, for Duty in Moral Obedience, or inſtituted Worſhip, is a ſin; not but that Inſtituted Worſhip is fundamentally Moral Obedience, but is therefore in ſome ſenſe diſtinguiſhed from it, (the ſerving of God according to his own appointment, being the principal part of the Moral Law) becauſe God hath, according to the ſeveral ſtates of his Church, altered the mode and manner of his Worſhip, as he hath thought it beſt in his Wiſdom, and as hath bin moſt ſuitable to the ſeveral ages and ſtates of his Church; which alterable or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Circumſtances, being the product of Chriſt's Prerogative alone, are called his Inſtituted Worſhip.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Hence both theſe Juriſdictions are Primarily and Morally ſubjected to the King of Kings; he orders, diſpoſeth of, and rules in the Kingdoms of men, as well as in his Church and hearts of men: yea, by ruling Heart and Conſcience, as well as by diſpoſing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he rules Civil States, and ſubordinate Societies; but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt difference is here, that God's political Rule in the Kingdoms of the Earth, and humane States, is more remote and mediate: but that of Church and Conſcience being Spiritual, is more proximate and immediate. He only gives general Laws to Civil Societies, and leaves a limited Legiſlative Power, as to particular, collateral, and incident caſes, to humane Governours, ſubſtituted providentially by him. To theſe he leaves the immediate adminiſtration of Rule and Government, as to an Executive Power altogether, and as to a Legiſlative Power in a great meaſure; but hath reſerved the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate adminiſtration of Rule in his Spiritual Dominions, to himſelf alone, as to Legiſlation in his Church, and both Legiſlation and Execution as to Conſcience.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Theſe two Modes or Degrees of Adminiſtration, muſt not be confounded together: Man muſt have no greater ſhare in Rule and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135610:6"/>Government, than God hath deputed him to; he is not to rob Chriſt of one jot of that Glory, which he hath reſerved to himſelf, under any pretence whatever; neither doth Chriſt permit, that by a plea of being under his more ſpiritual and immediate Juriſdiction, we ſhould exempt ourſelves from the equal Laws and Juriſdiction of man; for by Chriſts Laws all his Members are firmly bound upon both accounts: <hi>Give unto Ceſar the things that are Ceſar's, and unto God the things that are Gods. Fear God, Honour the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 5. Leſt we ſhould be miſtaken in the true nature of either of theſe, it is needful that they be both diſtinctly ſpoken unto; firſt of Chriſt's immediate Juriſdiction, and then of his more mediate, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Regimen Politicum vel Temporale,</hi> to which a Chriſtian is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; the other <hi>Spirituale.</hi> But to make way to them, we ſhall ſpeak briefly firſt to the nature of the two Adminiſtrations of Power, that will be ſo often mentioned, <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Executive.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Legiſlative and Executive Power.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. DIvine Power is exerted, either in giving being, which is Creation; or diſpoſing of that being, ſuitable to the ends of Creation, and that is Providence: This latter conſiſts in Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or Gubernation of created Beings to their reſpective ends. The latter of which being a ruling of the Creature by certain Laws, according to the Will of God the Creator, is either <hi>Legiſlative</hi> or <hi>Executive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. <hi>A Legiſlative Power</hi> is a Power of making and giving a Law. To compoſe and draw up a Law is not enough,

               </note> though with the greateſt exactneſs, and holding proportion with the ends deſigned; yet here the glorious Wiſdom of God is moſt reſplendent: but to give a Law, is to ſtamp an authoritative obliging Impreſſion upon it, whereby it tyes up the Subject to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and upon his failure unavoidably lays him under guilt.</p>
            <p>§ 3. <hi>A Legiſlative Power</hi> is either <hi>Sovereign and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimited,</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate and Limited. A Sovereign unlimited</hi> Legiſlative Power, is a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135610:7"/>Power in making and giving a Law, <hi>(pro placito vel arbitrio Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris)</hi> both for the matter and manner of it. In this there is nothing but <hi>Placitum Legiſlatoris,</hi> which gives him any Limitation; he doth whatever he will, in conſtituting the nature and parts of this Law, and ordaining the Subjects to it, and how far obliged by it: So that here the Legiſlators Will and Pleaſure, is a Law unto himſelf, and nothing elſe. Hence it muſt be ſuppoſed that this Lawgiver muſt have as much Power over the Subject, as it's poſſible for a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator to have over a Creature; elſe he cannot put him under what Law and Limits of Obligation he pleaſeth: And thence it is that this Lawgiver muſt not be accountable to any other for his doings, he is Supreme to all, Subordinate to none; renders no account of his matters, and therefore moſt irreſiſtible: So as none can demand an account of him, nor none can oppoſe him; he hath ſtrength to impoſe this Law where he ſees good. For thoſe Laws are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, that have not ſome kinde of impoſing force going along with them, to faſten on the inward man a Conſcience of Duty; or on the outward man, by reſpect to Rewards or Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Hence he muſt be moſt wife, to will ſuch a Law as is moſt ſuitable to his own nature, and agreeing to that way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is determined by himſelf, as to the created nature of the Subject to be governed: And that it may be ſo, it is requiſite he ſhould be moſt good; and that not only in himſelf, but relatively ſo; <hi>i. e.</hi> to have the greateſt obligation to diſtribute Bounty and Goodneſs to his Subjects, of which there can be none greater, than of the Creator to the works of his own hands: Neither muſt this Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flow from any other than a Fountain of freedom and liberty to act more or leſs this way or another, as he ſhall pleaſe, for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his fore-determined Glory. And then laſtly, which way ſoever the glory of this beſt being, Legiſlative, Executive, or other, be demonſtrated on the Subject (ſo much at his diſpoſal) it muſt needs be granted, that this is the beſt and wiſeſt way for the manifeſtation of that Glory fore-intended in the diſpoſal of the Creature: His will and pleaſure being certainly the moſt exquiſite and abſolute prime Rule of all goodneſs; therefore, as it is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably the moſt abſurd and irrational preſumption in man, to aſſume to himſelf, or lay the leaſt pretended claim to this Supremacy or Soveraignty of Law-giving; ſo it may not be attributed in the leaſt to any but God alone, the firſt, abſoluteſt, wiſeſt, beſt, and moſt independent Being.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:135610:7"/>
            <p>§ 5. A <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power may be alſo ſuch as is limited by, and ſubordinated to the will of a ſuperior Legiſlator; and therefore the power of ſuch an one is not of himſelf and primitive, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from ſome other: Neither is it bounded by his own Pleaſure, but by that of another, to whom he is accountable; becauſe he himſelf is liable to a Law, which Law he may tranſgreſs, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch Laws to his Subjects, which he is not commiſſionated by his Superior Law-giver to give; and <hi>Ergo</hi> muſt not make Laws <hi>Pro arbitrio ſine limitibus,</hi> his <hi>arbitrium</hi> being received from another, and the bounds allotted it, as to all <hi>Jus agendi pro beneplacito;</hi> he may act indifferently this way, or that way, in ſuch a compaſs; but if he paſs the Line of his Circumference, he becomes a tranſgreſſing Ruler. He ſins againſt his Superiour, and wrongs his Subject.</p>
            <p>§ 6. Hence (this ſubordinate Legiſlator thus trangreſſing) the Subject being conſcious and clearly convinced thereof, he is diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from all active obedience unto any ſuch uſurping or tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Laws. A Chriſtian's firſt and greateſt obligation being to the Supream and Soverain Power, as a Citizen in a Town-corporate is firſt bound in obedience to his Prince, before he is to the Mayor or Bayliff of the Town. An Officer ſubſtitute by the Prince, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable at his pleaſure, (it's not ſo in natural and contracted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations) knowing his obedience to the King, will ſufficiently juſtifie his non ſubmiſſion to the will of the Mayor.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Again, the Subject is obliged to obey the Laws which the inferiour Law-giver makes lawfully, (<hi>i. e.</hi> according to his depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) not <hi>Simpliciter &amp; gratiâ illius,</hi> but primarily and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for the ſake of the ſupream Law-giver whoſe Subſtitute and Repreſentative he is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. and they are ſo far to be obeyed, but no farther to be owned as lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
            <p>§ 8. Thus much of a Legiſlative Power in general. An Executive Power is a Power of putting in Execution a Law made, or the practical Application thereof according to the manifeſted will and intendment of the Law-giver. Therefore the power of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is always a <hi>ſecundary</hi> and derived Power, in reſpect of the Power of <hi>Legiſlation;</hi> becauſe it ſuppoſeth a Law made, and the will of the Law-giver to put it in practice; which Will is the ground of Execution, but is not actually begun till the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a poſitive injunction binding unto practice: and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135610:8"/>either in performing acts of obedience, and receiving the Law-encouragements; (this is chiefly on the part of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;) or in caſe of diſobedience, by executing the vindicative part of the Law, which belongs to the ſubſtituted Executioners to do, and the Subject to ſubmit unto. So that all Laws are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in obedience, and giving the ſtated reward thereunto; which ſatisfaction, <hi>Ergo,</hi> partly depends on the Subject, partly on the Ruler executing; or they are diſſatisfied in diſobedience, &amp; therefore right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in executing the minatory part on Offenders. Hence all Laws are capable of being ſatisfied or fulfilled, as to their whole intent and purpoſe, one of theſe ways, in Active or Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience on the part of the Subject; and the faithful diſcharge of the executive Power by Governours in the due diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Hence <hi>Executive Power is Obediential or Judicial. Obediential</hi> is an executive ability in the Subject bound; for by his obedience unto the Law, he executes and fulfills the will of the Law-giver, moſt properly as to the firſt intentions; for the firſt end of the Law, and deſigne of its Maker, is actual Obedience, and both in the Command and Penalty annexed. And in this ſence the meaneſt Subject doth put in execution the Law of his Soverain, at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſt in adminiſtration of <hi>commutative Juſtice</hi> towards the Magiſtrate, in rendring him his own, as well as towards his Fellow-ſubjects, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice to them.</p>
            <p>§ 11. <hi>Judicial executive Power</hi> is when the <hi>Law-giver</hi> or his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes,</hi> judging of Obedience or Diſobedience, as to matter of fact, do judicially determine the ſame, by and according to the true intent and meaning of the Law; and finding Obedience, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute the due rewards and encouragements thereunto; and jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Diſobedience <hi>omiſſive or commiſſive,</hi> do inflict all penalties in ſuch caſes by the Law provided: The faithful diſcharge of which Truſt, belongs to Governours, and is rightly called Diſtributive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>

That unlimited Supream Power which is every where aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to God, is Chriſt's; not onely as God the ſecond perſon in the <hi>God-head,</hi> but as <hi>Mediator God-man,</hi> conſtituted by the Father Head over the Church, and over all things to the Church; ſee <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he exerts this power not onely as <hi>Creator,</hi> but as <hi>Mediator,</hi> and as ſuch a Legiſlative power belongs to him, not onely properly and <hi>primarily,</hi> as being the <hi>political Head</hi> of his Church; but <hi>ſecundarily</hi> (for its ſake) he exerts ſuch a Power over all Societies in the world: and having this ſupream Legiſlation in his hands, he can make what Laws he pleaſe, and ſubſtitute others to what Law-making-power he pleaſeth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt them with, or determine how far in that kinde they may act at their diſcretion or arbitrement. So that Chriſt rules his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes either by his own <hi>immediate Legiſlative adminiſtration,</hi> or <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> by inferiour limited Law-givers; he rules by himſelf, or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>§ 3. His immediate rule is eſpecially to be conſidered as more General or more Special, as he is <hi>Creator,</hi> or as he is <hi>Redeemer.</hi> God as Creator of all natural Agents, he onely can command his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what it muſt do in order to thoſe ends for which it was created; and this government of natural Agents, is in a ſenſe of a Spiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, proceeding in a ſpiritual manner from a glorious Spirit for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ends, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of Gods Soverainty, Power, Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all the Creation praiſing him, and <hi>aſcribing Glory and Honour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135610:9"/>unto the Lamb;</hi> which Glory is ſubordinated to that which ſhines forth more reſplendidly in his Church; and he diſpoſing all things in order to his advancement therein to the higheſt honour and dignity, this Government of Chriſt may be ſaid to be a ſpiritual Rule and Government.</p>
            <p>§ 4. This <hi>General Government</hi> may be conſider'd, as he rules <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible or non-intelligible Creatures;</hi> theſe he rules by the Inſtincts of Nature, (which may be and are called his Statutes and Ordinances) which are no other than the impreſſion of the Will of him that made them: As in a Watch, or any piece of curious Mechaniſm, the minde of the Workman is plainly read in all the parts thereof. He ruleth <hi>intelligible natural</hi> Agents, ſuch as Angels and Men, by higher Laws. What the Law of Angels is, we ſhall not diſcuſs now, nor determine; but that they are Govern'd by a Law, I doubt not but may be proved, both from the ſin of them that fell, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for <hi>where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi> The Law ruling Men, as rational Agents, is a Law of Manners, ruling all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane motions that are <hi>cum electione;</hi> for ſome natural motions in man are <hi>per neceſſitatem Naturae,</hi> as the running of the Blood in the Veins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but theſe are under the Gubernation of natural Inſtinct. And as God faſtens his Law of Nature by inſtinct on the <hi>unintelligible Agents;</hi> ſo on Agents <hi>per electionem,</hi> he fixeth his Moral Law by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience, which is a kinde of rational moral Inſtinct, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the very Gentiles <hi>that have not the written Law,</hi> are in a great meaſure convinced of the nature of it, and their Duty in obedience thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13, 14. and in this ſence he <hi>enlightneth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> Joh. 1. and from this Law of moral Light cloſing with natural Conſcience, ariſeth <hi>accuſation</hi> or <hi>excuſation,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>obedience or diſobedience</hi> yielded thereto, whereby Chriſt in a manner rules in all men, at leaſt laying a claim to his right of Dominion, ſo much diſowned and rejected by the prevailing Law of ſin; and this may be aſcribed to Chriſts <hi>ſpiritual rule,</hi> it being his peculiar Prerogative to govern in Conſcience; and notwithſtanding ſins rebellion in all natural men, yet Chriſt there retains his ſeat of Judicature, and as he judgeth and condemneth now, ſo he will by the ſame Law prove them unexcuſable at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>§ 5. The more ſpecial <hi>immediate juriſdiction of Chriſt,</hi> is his moſt proper <hi>ſpiritual, mediatorly</hi> adminiſtration of rule towards his purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ones; and this is twofold, in or over <hi>perſons particularly, or in and over bodies politick. In and over particular perſons</hi> his Throne is the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135610:9"/>ſame (<hi>viz.</hi> Conſcience) in the <hi>regenerate and unregenerate,</hi> onely he rules theſe <hi>legally,</hi> and the other <hi>evangelically;</hi> theſe by a Law of Fear, them by a Law of Love: merely natural men, by a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Works; Believers, by a diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace: And here <hi>the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt rules in a Chriſtians Heart,</hi> and the Conſcience according to rule acquits or condemns. Neither is the true regulating force of the Moral Law any way extinct, but the terrifying embondaging nature of it removed, or at leaſt abated, any remainder of which is called the <hi>Spirit of Bondage;</hi> neither is there therefore two Laws in a Believer, <hi>Moral and Evangelical;</hi> but the Moral Law is evangeliz'd to him by his new <hi>relation to Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Curſe</hi> being taken away due to the ſinner, and he coming under another obligation to an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential conformity to the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the greateſt ties of love and thankfulneſs; and hence his Obedience is called <hi>New Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 6. Another part of his ſpecial and <hi>immediate Government</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in his giving Laws to his Church Militant, and deputation of Miniſters for execution thereof; and therefore he is called <hi>The Head of his Church,</hi> Eph. 1.22. Hence his Apoſtles and Prophets durſt not teach any thing but what they had immediately from him either by word or tradition, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and we may boldly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, as <hi>James</hi> 4.12. there is but one Law-giver; and though it be ſo plain and indiſputable a truth, yet becauſe men of corrupt mindes, by practice and argument, have made it their great aim to rob Chriſt of this Prerogative; we ſhall make it the principal part of the enſuing Diſcourſe to illuſtrate and confirm this poſition againſt all <hi>humane <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 7. Chriſt's <hi>immediate Government</hi> of his <hi>Church Militant,</hi> is not to be underſtood as if he had not appointed the <hi>executive adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be by Paſtors and other Officers deputed by himſelf, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. but the meaning is, that it is <hi>immediate,</hi> theſe two manner of ways. 1. In that he hath not authorized or commiſſionated any ſuch Officers or Governours on earth, who may compoſe and enact new Laws for the diſciplining of his Church in the order and manner of his inſtituted Worſhip; his own Laws here are onely binding. 2. In that all Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers receive their <hi>executive power</hi> from Chriſt immediately <hi>(nullo Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa aut Epiſcopo mediante)</hi> neither have any of them any power of <hi>deputation</hi> or <hi>ſubſtitution</hi> of others to execute that Office or Power committed to themſelves by Chriſt. And herein lieth the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135610:10"/>between Chriſt's <hi>immediate reign</hi> in his Church, and <hi>his mediate</hi> in the Kingdoms of men; and for this, amongſt other differences which <hi>Ameſius</hi> makes between the <hi>Magiſtratical and Miniſterial</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, he ſaith, <hi>Magiſtratus juriſdictionem habet cum Imperio, atque adeo (ſi ſummus ſit) juſtâ ratione poſſit leges condere &amp; abolere, atque juriſdictionem aliis mandare. Sed Miniſtri Eccleſiaſtici in ſeſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati, ſunt mandatorii meri, qui proprii nihil habent, ſed quiequid legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time agunt, id omne vice Chriſti mandantis agunt, atque adeo neque le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges poſſunt ferre, neque aliis mandare poteſtatem illam quam acceperunt,</hi> Medul. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. § 48.</p>
            <p>§ 8. The chief of our aſſertion about the immediate Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt concerns his <hi>Legiſlative power,</hi> that where-ever he governs in this manner, he hath reſerved the <hi>Law-giving-power</hi> to himſelf, as his peculiar Prerogative as to natural Agents. Who can give and preſcribe Laws, for ſuch orderly and natural direction of them to their ſeveral places and ends, but the Creator alone? Who can give Ordinances to the Sun, Moon, and Stars; ſet a bound to the Seas; command the former and latter Rain; appoint the viciſſitudes of Day and Night, Summer and Winter, Spring and Autumn? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and would not ſuch a Creature be juſtly chargeable with the greateſt folly and preſumption, that ſhould pretend to ſuch a Power? and therefore God challengeth <hi>Job</hi> on this account, <hi>Job</hi> 38. As for Conſcience, all are witneſſes that will deal but impartially in the acknowledgment of the truth, that there is nothing lays a true obligation thereon, but a Divine Law; neither do Humane Laws any farther binde Conſcience, than they are dependent upon, or reducible unto ſome Divine Law; and therefore all true obedience to them is for the Lords ſake. As for the Church, he always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed what Law and Rule he would have the affairs thereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by. The Church of the Jews had her Laws from Chriſt, though under a more legal and typical Diſpenſation, executed in the <hi>miniſtration of</hi> Moſes, and of other Miniſters of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that <hi>Levitical Oeconomy.</hi> So in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> he ſent forth his Miniſters to teach onely ſuch Laws and Orders of his Houſe as he himſelf had inſtituted and appointed; and he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in that reſpect in his Houſe, which in ſome reſpect is more properly his, (the Old Teſtament-Church being called <hi>Moſes</hi>'s houſe) becauſe the will of Chriſt is here more plainly and fully diſpenſed, and adminiſtred more immediately; Chriſt acting there by the miniſtration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the delivery of Levitical Laws, and for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135610:10"/>conſtituting and ruling the Body Politick of his Church: but in the latter days of the Goſpel, God ſpake to us by his Son Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately himſelf, delivering the order and manner of the Goſpel-Church when he was here on earth; and after his Aſcention, by his Spirit inſpiring his Apoſtles and ſuch as were extraordinarily quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the primitive times, ſince which he hath managed that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by his ordinary Miniſters, acting according to the Rules and Preſcripts left behinde him in his holy Word.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IIII. <hi>Of Chriſt's Mediate Legiſlative Power.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. HAving ſomewhat treated of the <hi>immediate Juriſdiction</hi> of Chriſt, it's needful to ſpeak a little of his <hi>Mediate,</hi> viz. how far he rules Bodies Politick by the mediation of man, or hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a power of law-making and executing unto him; and to ſhew that mans power cannot be <hi>indefinite and unlimited,</hi> but <hi>deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative and limited:</hi> and for the illuſtrating hereof, we are to examine whence man hath his Civil Power, and how far it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
            <p>§ 2. All Civil Powers have their juſt Authority from Chriſt the King of Kings, <hi>the Head of all Principalities, Powers, Body Politicks, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,</hi> as is manifeſted by the following Scriptures and ſuch others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, 4. wherefore it is the manifeſt will of Chriſt, 1. That there ſhould be Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world. 2. That the perſonal poſſeſſion of it be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the all-diſpoſing Providence of God. 3. That it's an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and appointment of Chriſt, that ſuch <hi>execute diſtributive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for the encouragement of Well-doers, and diſcouragement of Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers.</hi> 4. That in the faithful diſcharge of this truſt, <hi>they are Gods Miniſters attending his work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. As the King of Kings hath given Magiſtrates their power, ſo he hath ſet them their bounds of Government, inſomuch that they be not <hi>Plenipotentiary,</hi> but are liable to the Law of the ſupream Law-giver; which they may tranſgreſs, in reſpect either of the Laws themſelves, or of perſons ſubjected to them. In reſpect of the Laws two ways, in <hi>Law-making, or Executing.</hi> In Law-making
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135610:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>theſe ways. 1. When they preſume to enact ſuch Laws, as directly croſs any of Chriſt's Laws, either the Law of Nature, to enjoyn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural things; or when he by his Law ſhall contradict the Moral Law, or any Appendix thereunto. Or laſtly, controul the Laws of Chriſt for the Oeconomy of his Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> in making any Laws to obſtruct the execution of Chriſts Laws, according to his revealed Will. 2. He may tranſgreſs in Law-making, by entrenching on the <hi>Legiſlative Prerogative of Chriſt,</hi> either in reſpect of <hi>Moral Obedience,</hi> or <hi>Inſtituted Worſhip,</hi> or any Forms or Rites thereto belonging. 3. In failing to Enact ſuch uſeful and neceſſary Laws, as are needful and requiſite for the right ordering or management of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, or particular Subjects under his Dominion. He may fail and tranſgreſs in <hi>Law Executing,</hi> either in a ſlack or careleſs execution of good Laws, or undue application of them, or partial diſtribution of Juſtice by them, all which is <hi>Injuſtitia:</hi> or he may fail in too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and extreme proſecution, and ſo be guilty of <hi>Summum Jus,</hi> which ſince the Fall is <hi>Maxima Injuria,</hi> becauſe there is no allowance or abatement for the natural failings and weakneſſes of the Subjects obeying.</p>
            <p>§. 4. As he is liable to tranſgreſs as to Laws, ſo alſo as to perſons; 1. By <hi>a partial Execution of Juſtice,</hi> with reſpect of perſons. 2. In preſſing the power of his Law further on perſons than Chriſt ever permitted, as in endeavouring to impoſe on Conſcience, and bring it into thraldom, by forcing men to ambiguous Oaths, Declarations, or Subſcriptions. 3. When he uſeth his Power for the obſtructing and hindering the Members of Chriſt in the uſe of thoſe Priviledges, or lawful Liberties, granted them by Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>§ 5. Whence it appears, That the <hi>Civil Magiſtrates Juriſdiction</hi> is limited to the <hi>Civil State,</hi> and to all perſons and things conſidered in <hi>a Civil capacity.</hi> And thus far he hath Power over the perſons of Chriſtians, and particular Churches whilſt Militant; ſo far as they are perſons and Societies laying claim to Civil Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, or capable of doing or receiving wrong and injury, being men ſubject to Paſſions and Failures with the reſt of Mankinde. A Chriſtian is ſubjected (as hath been ſaid) to a twofold Juriſdiction, <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>External: Internal</hi> reſpects the Juriſdiction of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or God's ruling man by it; and here is an impoſſibility of any third perſons interpoſing between God and us. The <hi>External Regiment</hi> to which a Chriſtian is ſubjected is <hi>Political,</hi> and that by God's Ordination is twofold; <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Body <hi>Civilly Politick,</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135610:11"/>
               <hi>Spiritually</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtically Politick;</hi> this is ſubjected immediately to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual Gubernation</hi> of Chriſt alone; the other <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mediately</hi> under the Rule of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate.</hi> Now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between theſe two <hi>Polities,</hi> hath been the Original of moſt of the Trouble in the Chriſtian World. Since Chriſt's preſence here on Earth, it hath always been mans preſumptuous Ambition to ſit in his Throne, more or leſs. Sometimes Secular Dignities aſſuming to themſelves <hi>Legiſlation</hi> in matters of Divine Worſhip, whence hath aroſe ſo great Perſecutions from Magiſtrates; becauſe Chriſt's Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers refuſed to betray or deliver his Prerogative into their hands, and judged themſelves bound to obey God rather than man. Again, ſometimes uſurping Officers in the Church, pretending to a derived Power from Chriſt, have aſſumed the place of Chriſt himſelf, in and over his Church, juſtling him (as much as in them lay) out of his Throne; hence hath aroſe the <hi>Antichriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> tyrannizing not only over Bodies Politick, but over Conſcience it ſelf: and (as a juſt Judgment on Civil Powers, which <hi>will not kiſs the Son, but break his bonds,</hi> and abuſe his Churches and Members) have bin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Chriſt to ſet their feet on the necks of Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Earth; the intolerable burthen the Earth groans under, and hath done for many Ages: and were they but removed each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its proper ſphere, <hi>i. e.</hi> were but the Churches of Chriſt eaſed of Civil Uſurpations in ſome Nations and Commonwealths, from Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical in other, and Conſcience delivered from the rapes, wrongs and injuries inſolently offer'd to it from both, the Chriſtian World would become ſuch a Paradiſe of Felicity, that ſcarce yet hath bin ſince the Infancy of the Goſpel-Church; and without ſuch reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World to the due Liberties of Church and State, we cannot enjoy that worldly Felicity which a good man is capable of.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Concerning the Nature of Conſcience.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. Having thus far briefly enquired concerning the <hi>Juriſdictions</hi> a Chriſtian is bound in Duty to ſubmit unto, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135610:12"/>and <hi>Caeſars;</hi> and though he is conſcientiouſly to ſubject himſelf unto both, yet Chriſts Authority is to be preferred, and he is to have his due in the firſt place; becauſe all others who derive all juſt and rightful Authority from him, are limited by him, and muſt give an account unto him: Therefore we ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty; give unto the Lord the Glory due unto his Name.</hi> And as commanded by Chriſt, <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs thereof,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>§ 2. The firſt thing then here to be done, is to vindicate the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of Chriſt,</hi> both in the perſons of particular Chriſtians, and in Eccleſiaſtick Bodies Politick, in both which he hath reſerved the Legiſlative Power to himſelf, and never yet committed it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And firſt of his Power in Conſcience; and that it may the more clearly appear, that Chriſt only rules in Conſcience, it is needful we a little explain the Nature of Conſcience, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to prove, that the Juriſdiction of it belongs to Chriſt alone</p>
            <p>§ 3. Conſcience taken ſtrictly <hi>(ſecundum notationem nominis)</hi> is a Knowledge together; <hi>i. e.</hi> A mans knowledg of himſelf and his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with another who knows the ſame with him; or as ſome think, the knowledge of his <hi>Actions,</hi> together with the <hi>Rule</hi> by which they ought to be ſquared and directed; which knowledge muſt be placed in the Underſtanding of a rational Creature. Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> ſaith, <hi>It's a part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> I had rather ſay, it is <hi>Modus Intellectus;</hi> for the Underſtanding acts <hi>per totum, non per par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> This is that <hi>Spirit of a man, which knows the things that are in a man,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11. But it's not all kinde of Intelligence, but ſome only in particular. 1. Not a <hi>Theoretick</hi> Knowledge, but a <hi>Practick;</hi> and therefore always referring to ſome <hi>Action,</hi> or <hi>Omiſſion.</hi> And 2. It is not referred to another mans affairs, but his own whoſe it is. And laſtly, it is not a mere apprehenſion or ſuſpicion, but a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, always at leaſt of the fact, and often determines by the Rule known of the Legality of the fact, and ſo paſſeth Judgment, and thence is called <hi>Judicium;</hi> but ſometimes Conſcience is doubtful here, and thence it is called a weak, doubtful, and ſcrupulous Conſcience.</p>
            <p>§ 4. It may be therefore thus deſcribed: <hi>Conſcientia eſt modus Intellectus Judicialis practicus. Conſcience is the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner of proceeding concerning our ſelves and actions.</hi> A man in Conſcience, as God's Subſtitute or Deputy, ſits in Judgment upon himſelf; firſt inquires as Jury of the matter of fact, whereof accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Self-evidence, he is found Guilty or Not-guilty, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135610:12"/>to the Law manifeſted, is acquitted or condemned. This Judgment of Conſcience may be conſidered in the power and act; a man may have a Conſcience-power, which doth not exert and put forth act; as a Man in Infancy or in Sleep; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it may be called <hi>Poteſtas intellectiva,</hi> Intellectual Power reducible into act. Again, Intellectual Power is either <hi>Intuitiva vel ratiocinativa;</hi> that is, the intuitive, which is the Viſion or Underſtanding of a Truth <hi>Axioma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically,</hi> or in the Abſtract. <hi>Ratiocinativa,</hi> which is looking on ſeveral Truths compared together, and one Truth being laid by another by way of Collation, produceth a third Truth, which we call a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion or Inference. The firſt and general truth that comes to the knowledge, is the Law of God, which is brought to us by the light of Nature, or by the Word of God; which way ſoever it comes, it's enough to give it a throne in Conſcience, that it be certainly known to be God's Law. Nextly, that our actions are laid by this Rule, or brought before this Judgment-ſeat; which two being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly brought together, a third neceſſary Truth or Judgment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, doth reſult, and is accordingly pronounced; the certainty of which depends on the certainty of the <hi>Premiſes,</hi> or at leaſt the exact and juſt comparing them together. The Underſtanding thus behaving it ſelf, puts on the nature of actual Conſcience, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in act, bringing the habitual or potential Conſcience into acts in this manner, either concerning a mans ſtate or actions. Concerning a mans ſtate, <hi>The Soul that ſins ſhall die:</hi> I have ſinned, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Or concerning his particular actions: He that committeth Idolatry or Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> breaketh God's Law; but I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch and ſuch an act which is ſo, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 5. Hence Conſcience ruled by Chriſt's Prerogative, <hi>is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical reaſoning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> (or <hi>Modus intellectus practicus</hi>) in man, whereby a judgment may be paſſed concerning a mans ſelf by himſelf, according to his apprehenſion of the revealed Judgment and Will of God; its <hi>divine Authority</hi> that rules in mans Heart, as to the <hi>approbation</hi> or <hi>condemnation</hi> of himſelf or actions. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the very blinde Heathens admit of no other power to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit or condemn in this kind, but either the convincing light of the moral Law written in them, or ſome ſuppoſed falſe Divine light which by reaſon of the blindneſs of their Hearts ſeduceth them to falſe Worſhip and Idolatry.</p>
            <p>§ 6. The <hi>method of Conſcience</hi> his acting is thus; firſt, there is the general undoubted truth known or aſſented to as ſuch; and it's either
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135610:13"/>that which is really ſo, or ſuppoſedly ſo only, and not ſo really; if it be the latter, it's the main foundation of an erring Conſcience. It is the proſpect of ſome apprehended Divine Truth or other, <hi>Moral, Levitical,</hi> or <hi>Evangelical,</hi> which obligeth us to acts of Obedience; and this Law-obligation laid by God on man, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>the Propoſition</hi> of a practical Syllogiſme made by Conſcience. 2. There is the <hi>Application</hi> of this Truth to our ſelves, either as to our ſtate or particular actions, according to our own knowledge, (together with God's) to judge of our <hi>Conformity</hi> or <hi>Non-conformity</hi> to the ſaid Law-obligation, and therefore concerning the goodneſs or evil of our Actions: and here we take the <hi>Candle of the Lord in our hands to ſearch out</hi> and examine our condition and actions, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to good or evil; and herein doth the chief nature of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience conſiſt: becauſe it's a ſubmitting ourſelves and actions to the judgment of God's Law, and is therefore the Aſſumption of this practical Syllogiſme, and is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and is <hi>an Index, Record, Teſtimony, Witneſs.</hi> 3. There is the <hi>Criſis, Inference,</hi> or <hi>Concluſion</hi> neceſſarily deduced from the Premiſes, and this is called the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſed upon our ſtate or actions. Thus we have the whole <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> which the underſtanding makes in this way of acting. The Propoſition is <hi>de Jure;</hi> the Aſſumption <hi>de Facto:</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is either a juſtification of perſon or action, or it's a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of any of them found guilty.</p>
            <p>§ 7. The <hi>Syntereſis</hi> is the light of Truth contained in the Law <hi>(N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that <hi>Syntereſis</hi> differs but <hi>ratione</hi> from the Law itſelf; for it is the Law of God underſtood and yielded to as obliging unto practice, and it's not only the Law in its Letter and firſt Principles, in its <hi>Original poſitive</hi> nature; but in its <hi>aptitude</hi> to particular Caſes, and in its juſt Inferences and Conſequences dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from generals thereof, all practical Truths pleading Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, juſtly obliging us to belief.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:135610:13"/>
            <p>§ 8. That which ſtirs up the Underſtanding to compare Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Actions with the divine Law in the aſſumption by a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal enquiry, is a certain obligation which this Law-light hath the Heart of man under, that it doth by a kinde of natural inſtinct act in the manner above-rehearſed; which obligation is a neceſſity laid on the Underſtanding of owning and aſſenting to every known Law of God, and thereby to make a practical diſquiſition and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment accordingly. The reaſon of this <hi>obligation</hi> lieth much in the neceſſity of the object: And firſt the natural inclination the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath to every known truth as ſuch: but this is not all; for truth that obligeth to credence from the evidence of it, obligeth not to <hi>Practice</hi> and Obedience, having not a ſufficient authority from whence it comes, or not laying on us a neceſſity of obeying, and therefore it muſt binde as a Law-truth, challenging its ends by <hi>promiſes</hi> of <hi>rewards,</hi> or <hi>threats</hi> of <hi>puniſhment.</hi> Again, 'tis from a principle of <hi>ſelf-love</hi> and preſervation. Seeing our ſelves liable to a Law, and ſuch a Law that can do us good or hurt, we are bound by this firſt principle of nature to make an impartial enquiry into our conformity, that we may be ſatisfied of our own ſafety and danger, every one being deſirous in this caſe to know the worſt of himſelf. Moreover, ſeeing that all Law that bindes is backed with ſufficient power to put it into vigorous and impartial execution; and that which prevails ſo much with Conſcience, is the Law-givers abſolute power to ſave and deſtroy. He can puniſh the whole man, <hi>Body and Soul,</hi> which no humane Power can: So that the Penalty being great, and the power of the Law-giver infinite, it muſt needs lay the Conſcience under a very ſtrict bond of enquiry. Likewiſe if we conſider, that 'tis not onely a ſufficient power for <hi>Execution,</hi> but an <hi>unlimited power</hi> of law-making, wherein his Soverainty doth chiefly conſiſt; which Soverainty, as it is moſt <hi>ſupream,</hi> ſo it is moſt <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> and therefore this obligeth, becauſe God can make what Law he will, and he cannot will to make any Law that is not fit for his Creature to obey. Hence his Laws have always a neceſſary innate goodneſs in them, becauſe they flow from him who is <hi>primarily, abſolutely,</hi> and <hi>independently</hi> good, <hi>Ergo</hi> muſt be, cannot but be, <hi>holy, juſt, and good Laws.</hi> Wherefore the impreſſion of the goodneſs of a Divine Law is firmly fixed on mans natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; however corruption may attempt the blotting it out it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not totally do it; but thoſe who are renewed by Grace, muſt needs ſee anothergueſs luſtre in it, ſeeing not onely Divine goodneſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135610:14"/>ſtamped on God's Law, but <hi>Goſpel-goodneſs:</hi> Not onely the <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> of his Commands to his <hi>Creature,</hi> but to a ſinner, <hi>viz.</hi> the love of God ſo evidenced in giving and requiring his Law in ſuch a way of Grace and compaſſion, that it engageth them in the higheſt meaſure to <hi>Obedience,</hi> yea, <hi>new Obedience,</hi> and their Conſciences to a diligent and narrow diſquiſition thereof accordingly. Laſtly, there is an <hi>innate reverence</hi> unto Divinity, which the Creator hath placed in the Heart of man, whereby the Law of God hath more command than any Laws in the world beſides; becauſe there can be no greater diſtance than between the Creator and the Creature; and Creation, or giving us being, is ſuch an obligation as none but a Creator can lay upon the Creature; and conſequently our greateſt good either in being or well-being, is certainly hazzarded by the diſpleaſure of our Creator. Thus much of the practical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Conſcience, from which of neceſſity follows the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Concluſion, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>§ 9. It remains to ſpeak ſomething of the <hi>diverſities of Conſcience,</hi> which admits of no difference from Divine Law ſimply conſidered, but from the Information or Illumination which the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding receives more or leſs therefrom. The <hi>leſs enlightned Conſcience,</hi> is either the mere natural Conſcience illuminated onely by the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> without a written Law, ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. Or the <hi>legal Conſcience,</hi> though enlightned by the written Law, yet taſting nothing of <hi>Goſpel-freedom</hi> and delivery by Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore in <hi>bondage</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the <hi>mediatorly Authority</hi> of Chriſt in <hi>Juſtification, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> or rules of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> walk. The more enlightned Conſcience, is that which hath received Goſpel-light, and ſubjected thereunto from a true ſence of the love of God in Chriſt, hath ſubmitted his ſelf and ways to the guidance and conduct thereof in his whole progreſs to Life and Salvation. The Conſcience admits alſo of <hi>Magis &amp; Minus:</hi> the more evangelically enlightned Conſcience is that which is firmly ratified and confirmed in Goſpel-truths, and a due appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof by Faith for comfort and practice; and this is a firm ſtable Conſcience, and of ſuch an one is rightly ſaid that he is a <hi>ſtrong Chriſtian,</hi> one that is rightly informed in his Duties and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges by the Law of Chriſt. The <hi>leſs Evangelically-enlightned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is one that hath but a <hi>ſmall information</hi> in the Minde and Will of Chriſt, hath a <hi>ſincere faith,</hi> but little <hi>knowledge,</hi> is not ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the rules of Goſpel-obedience, nor with his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135610:14"/>purchaſed by Jeſus Chriſt; and hence ariſeth a <hi>doubting</hi> and <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> Conſcience: a doubting Conſcience or Opinans is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect chiefly of the will and minde of Chriſt, is not fully reſolved concerning it, and therefore at beſt acts but from <hi>Opinion,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled, and unreſolved, whether the Light directs him this way, or that way; and therefore is unſtable in all ſuch ways, is not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with a <hi>Plerophory</hi> and <hi>full reſolution</hi> to perſiſt; and this may be according to ſome Truths and Duties, but not according to others. A Chriſtian may be ſtrong in reſpect of ſome Truths, but weak in reſpect of others; ſo that the ſame Conſcience may be ſtrong or weak, as it is clearly informed in ſome things, and darkly in others; yea, it may be weak at one time, and ſtrong at another, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives more or leſs Light. A ſcrupulous Conſcience is chiefly in reſpect of action, concerning which he is needleſly and frivolouſly doubtful, and therefore fearful and ſtarting upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Thus far of the differences of Conſcience, taken from <hi>Syntereſis;</hi> briefly a few words of its differences alſo from <hi>Syneideſis. Conſcience</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Syneideſis,</hi> into a <hi>good or a bad Conſcience.</hi> The <hi>good Conſcience</hi> is that which makes a diligent, juſt, and impartial enquiry into our condition and actions, by a due applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to the Rule or Law-light received by us. An <hi>evil Conſcience,</hi> is ſuch an one as from its enſlavery to a luſt doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its duty aright towards the Law of God or ourſelves, but is either <hi>ſloathful,</hi> and will not take pains to ſearch and examine our Hearts and ways: Or it is <hi>partial,</hi> and will be more ſtrict in ſome reſpects, and leſs in others of the ſame weight and concernment. Or it is <hi>fallacious,</hi> and deals not plainly and fully concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, but mincingly and equivocally, feigning it to be better than it is in <hi>ſubſtance</hi> or <hi>circumſtance:</hi> or 'tis <hi>ſtupid</hi> and <hi>blockiſh,</hi> not valuing the weight of the Law, or inſpecting the nature of the Action. It may be alſo <hi>troubleſomely evil</hi> (as well as negligently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) when it brings in too aggravating a Teſtimony, in accuſing beyond the nature of the Tranſgreſſion, repreſenting the matter of fact more hainous and heavy than it ought to be repreſented. Such a Conſcience may be <hi>Honeſtè bona,</hi> but <hi>Moleſtè mala.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 11. Laſtly, we diſtinguiſh Conſcience from the <hi>Criſis</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; and 'tis either <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>unjuſt.</hi> Juſt, when it denounceth Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence according to the true intent of the Law, and the true nature of the Fact, whereby it proves to be juſtly <hi>peaceable,</hi> or juſtly <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome</hi> and <hi>tormenting</hi> to us; and when it acquits, is <hi>pacatè bona.</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:135610:15"/>Or it is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> when the Sentence is pronounced otherwiſe than the premiſes do require; and when it thus acquits, it's <hi>pacatè mala;</hi> And when it thus condemns, leading many to the very brink of Deſpair, it is <hi>Iniquè &amp; crudeliter mala.</hi> The former is often a <hi>bribed Conſcience,</hi> captivated and carried away with the favour of ſome baſe beloved Luſt and Affection, and a <hi>brutiſh blind heatheniſh Conſcience, Jud.</hi> 10.2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. Or a <hi>judicially ſeared Conſcience,</hi> ſuch as is ſpoken of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. If it be <hi>iniquè mala,</hi> injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and cruelly evil, it will condemn where Chriſt hath acquitted; and this uſually from too much embondagement to the Law, which may be for a time in Saints and true Believers, and is called the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage,</hi> Rom. 8. A juſt peaceable Conſcience makes a happy man. A juſt, tormenting, or condemning Conſcience, makes a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man.</p>

            <p>THus far of the nature of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> next of the <hi>Dominion and Regiment,</hi> who it is that hath the immediate Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it. I ſhall ſhew therefore that the Government of Conſcience is the peculiar prerogative of God alone, and that 'tis Uſurpation for any to enter into that <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> and the higheſt <hi>preſumption</hi> to attempt it, it belonging to none other by right, nor poſſible for any other to attain: There being none able effectually to enjoyn Conſcience to do its duty in making judicial trials of our perſons and actions but God alone: If at any time Satan or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority ſet Conſcience on work, it's <hi>in nomine Dei, &amp; ſub prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textu divinae Authoritatis.</hi> And all humane Laws conſcientiouſly obeyed; are obeyed for the Lords ſake, ſuch obedience being commanded of God.</p>
            <p>§ 2. That it's Gods onely <hi>Prerogative to rule in Conſcience,</hi> doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by many reaſons. 1. God onely <hi>knows</hi> the Heart and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135610:15"/>and therefore is onely able to give a Law to it, and rule in it; if the one be his prerogative above men and Angels, the other muſt be alſo. 2. It's in Gods power onely to <hi>inflict puniſhment</hi> on Conſcience in caſe of tranſgreſſion. Men may puniſh the <hi>outward</hi> man, but cannot touch the <hi>inward</hi> man. Conſcience is not within the reach of his ſtroak; and they pretend in vain to a power of Law-making, who cannot execute it on the Subject for whom it is made. 3. The Conſcience is <hi>accountable</hi> to none but God, it being his immediate Subſtitute in man; he is Creator of it, and he never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it to any Law but <hi>for his ſake;</hi> all ſin as ſuch is againſt God, and no trangreſſion of humane Law becomes <hi>morally</hi> a ſin, but by its relation ſome way or other to <hi>Gods Law,</hi> by vertue of ſome of his general or particular Precepts or Commiſſions. 4. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the moſt <hi>univerſal or chiefeſt good or evil</hi> can oblige Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Obedience, or deter from Diſobedience; which none can make us partakers of, or ſufferers under, but God alone. Mens <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations</hi> are never more than <hi>temporal Rewards and Puniſhments;</hi> theſe Conſcience doth not, will not, it's not in the nature of it to ſtoop to them: The concerns of Conſcience are principally fixed on the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Eternal Eſtate,</hi> which none but the God of Spirits can bereave it of. Again, as God onely can lay down the firſt Rules of <hi>Truth and Errour</hi> to the Underſtanding, ſo he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines good and evil as a rule of the <hi>Will,</hi> and limitation of man in his <hi>Election,</hi> ſuitable to the nature of a <hi>free</hi> Agent, having an <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power</hi> over the <hi>Arbitrium</hi> of mans will, as well as over other things: For as he hath created the Will, ſo he hath determinated the Object that is moſt adequate to it, and not onely in <hi>genere boni,</hi> but in <hi>ſpecie moralis boni; Ergo</hi> God is the proper <hi>and immediate</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Underſtanding and Will of man in <hi>genere morali:</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no trangreſſion of the Laws of man brings any truely-enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Conſcience <hi>under guilt</hi> without conſulting the Minde and Will of God. A Childes not doing a Parents command, is not a ſin, (as ſuch) neither will it lay the Conſcience under guilt, any farther than it is a <hi>tranſgreſſion of Gods Law,</hi> i. e. diſobedience to them in thoſe things that God hath enjoyned obedience in. Childrens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Parents <hi>is in the Lord,</hi> ſo Subjects to Magiſtates; for both Parents and Magiſtrates do ſometimes command ſuch things, that it's a <hi>virtue,</hi> and not a <hi>vice,</hi> in Children or Subjects not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, ſo that their refuſal be accompanied with all ſubmiſſion, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and modeſty towards their Superiours. No man hath a moral
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135610:16"/>Legiſlative power over another; but all men in reſpect of moral Laws, at leaſt fundamentally underſtood, are liable and ſubject to the ſame King and Governour; and to his Tribunal will every Conſcience appeal before it will lie under <hi>true guilt,</hi> whatever the judgement of man is: And though men may torment or kill the outward man, and vex the Spirits becauſe of temporal Sufferings, yet the Conſcience will ſtand or fall onely by the Judgement of God. I may adde alſo, upon what authority we receive a truth of a Spiritual nature, ſo as to believe it by the ſame authority onely, ſhall we ſuffer if we diſobey it? but Conſcience believes no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual truth but upon Gods authority; <hi>Ergo</hi> it's by his authority onely that we ſhall ſuffer in Conſcience; and this is the reaſon that when men would impoſe their uſurpations, they ſtill bring a blinde along with them, <hi>viz.</hi> a pretence to God's Authority. Thus the Pope and his imitators in ſpiritual things, as alſo Secular Powers, will endeavour (by caſting a nooſe upon Conſcience as it ſtands in relation unto God) to make it ſerve their politick and carnal ends, by tying men up by Oaths indefinite to all their lawleſs Laws and Conſtitutions in Church and State. Laſtly, by the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and no other, by which men ſhall be judged at laſt, by the ſame is Conſcience ruled now. Thoſe that ſhall be judged by the Light of Nature, have God ruling and judging in them by the Light of Nature onely; ſo thoſe that ſhall be judged by the written Law, and by the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Now leſt there ſhould be any miſtake of our true meaning about <hi>this Dominion of Conſcience,</hi> let us take notice of a few diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions concerning Conſcience. Conſcience is to be conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its <hi>internal</hi> and its <hi>external</hi> acting. Its <hi>internal</hi> acting, is its <hi>believing, aſſenting, concurring, judging</hi> between <hi>fact and fact;</hi> or, <hi>disbelieving, diſſenting, condemning,</hi> &amp;c. and theſe are thoſe that are <hi>Actus eliciti;</hi> and they are not (without doubt) under any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law or Power in the world, either to force them where they are not, or to obſtruct them where they are. As men may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to do it by any external compulſion, ſo there is an impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the nature of the thing, that it can never be accompliſhed. 'Tis onely God's Prerogative to charge us to believe under a <hi>penalty,</hi> and the light of Truth carries demonſtration with it to challenge our <hi>aſſent,</hi> and call forth our underſtanding to a free acting, unleſs we be inveloped in the darkneſs of corrupt nature, or captivated in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to any Luſts. Neither is it in the power of man to remove
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135610:16"/>this vail; it's God onely by the light of Truth, working by its prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling evidence, and the mighty operation of the divine Spirit, which way it pleaſeth, that can effect this. Hence he that makes a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law, that this or that thing is a truth, and to be believed by me, to be aſſented and conſented unto, and doth endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel me to ſuch a belief and aſſent by the threats and puniſhments of this Law, doth uſurp a power that was never given unto him by God, neither was ever practicable to effect the end pretended to.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Secondly, There are external acts, <hi>(Actus imperati)</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as <hi>profeſſing, ſubſcribing, declaring, doing;</hi> but theſe are not properly acts of Conſcience, but from Conſcience, as they ought to be under the <hi>Rule and Dominion</hi> and direction of Conſcience, and will come to be duely conſidered in this place, whether any man may be thus compelled by any <hi>ſubordinate Power;</hi> and doubtleſs there is none that can compel a man to act <hi>from Conſcience,</hi> no more than he can compel him to underſtand or will what he pleaſeth: for though the acts are external, and may be compelled <hi>de facto,</hi> and in ſome caſes <hi>de jure,</hi> the principle of good or evil actions, <hi>viz.</hi> from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, cannot be compelled: the relation it hath to Conſcience is <hi>internal;</hi> as if a man be brought and forc'd upon his Knees before an Idol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is no formal act of Conſcience, for that ſtill reſiſts and oppoſeth the action; though it's improperly called a <hi>forcing of Conſcience,</hi> when a man is thus forced to an action againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: Indeed he is forcibly induced through fear, or ſenſe of ſome evil, to do or omit ſomething againſt his light and conviction; and the choice is alſo free, he being attended with ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet it is ſaid to be compelled, becauſe the argument of a <hi>Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to be incurred upon refuſal, is very ſtrong to reach fleſh, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſuffering of which, the Will is carried away to chuſe that as a <hi>comparative good,</hi> which the enlightned Underſtanding allows not as lawful, nor the Will as <hi>abſolutely good;</hi> and this is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of Conſcience which is moſt uſually found in the world. And here it will be enquired whether any Subordinate power can lawfully compel us to ſuch imperate acts? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I ſay men may make and execute <hi>de jure,</hi> ſuch a Law as many cannot in conſcience ſubmit unto by way of <hi>active obedience,</hi> ſo that it be really ſuch as the great Law-giver hath allowed them to make, and it be agreeable to the rules and limits of power committed to their charge, and the reaſon of refuſal be the <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>prejudice</hi> of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:135610:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Subject, or elſe no Laws could be made or executed in the world; for one or other that ſhould obey, would be pretending Conſcience againſt it: and here the Subject is to ſubmit either <hi>active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> if after ſufficient <hi>illumination</hi> he findes the goodneſs and juſtneſs of the Law-giver. If he doth not, he is to refuſe to act, if he is perſwaded it's utterly unlawful; but if it be doubtfully ſo, he is to ſuſpend his acts till he is better informed, and patiently ſubmit to the Magiſtrates will and pleaſure in the Penalty-execution: but if any Power endeavour to enforce obedience, that no Power ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting may lawfully do, and require us and force us with penalties, it's queſtionleſs very great Uſurpation. We muſt alſo conſider the matter about which this compulſion may be conceived to be. No Magiſtrate may compel to any thing againſt Conſcience, <hi>quatenus</hi> ſuch, <hi>Scil.</hi> under the formality and notion of being againſt Conſcience, that were the greateſt Tyranny in the world. Or we may underſtand it of compelling under the notion of Truth, and ſo a Faith muſt be enforced, which no man is capable of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing this way. Or, Thirdly, under the notion of Duty, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting how the Conſciences of perſons ſtand affected in relation to it on whom it is urged: And thus the Magiſtrate may compel to the doing of good, or avoiding of evil, by penal Edicts, though accidentally it may be againſt the Conſciences of ſome on whom it is impoſed; for the Magiſtrate being not a competent Judge of mens Conſciences, he cannot make other mens Conſciences the rule of his Laws and Executions, but the <hi>will of the Lord,</hi> whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters he is, and the <hi>good of the Commonweal</hi> that is committed to his truſt. The Magiſtrate is not to command or forbid any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the formality of being with or againſt Conſcience; but he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the Conſciences of his Subjects are convinced, being ſufficiently pre-informed, may command any thing to be done or forborn, according to that latitude of Rule and Government which he hath received from the Lord whoſe Miniſter he is; for the right knowledge whereof, he ought ſincerely and impartially to conſult the <hi>Word of God</hi> and his own Conſcience, and ſo to take the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his own Duty and Actions: Neither is his Conſcience the <hi>Standard</hi> to his Subjects; for <hi>every one muſt give an account of himſelf to God;</hi> the Magiſtrate for himſelf, as a Magiſtrate; and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for himſelf, as ſuch; and therefore the Conſcience of the Magiſtrate doth not binde the Subject to active obedience, though his relation to him as ſuch bindes him to <hi>Subjection,</hi> which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:135610:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>is abundantly ſhewed in his quiet and peaceable ſubmitting himſelf to the Law-penalty, if he cannot ſatisfie himſelf that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate acts in his place according to the revealed Minde and Will of God in ſuch caſes provided; which caſes alſo are always to be of a <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>politick</hi> nature, for here he hath power <hi>compulſory</hi> of the outward man <hi>mandatory,</hi> or <hi>prohibitory</hi> though the Conſcience of the Subject is or may be pretended to be againſt it.</p>
            <p>§ 5. And now that all cauſe of exception may be removed on all hands, it will be requiſite more explicitely to ſhew how far a Chriſtians Conſcience hath to do with <hi>humane Authority;</hi> and we grant that <hi>humane Authority</hi> in civil and politick affairs is <hi>an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God.</hi> 2. That if the Law be juſt and equitable, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is bound in Conſcience to yield poſitive active obedience, not onely for <hi>wrath, i. e.</hi> fear of threat and puniſhment, but for <hi>Conſcience ſake,</hi> becauſe the Law of God obligeth us to obedience to all the <hi>juſt Laws</hi> of men, <hi>civil Government</hi> being his appointment as much as <hi>Oeconomical;</hi> but it's not mans Law that nextly and immediately bindes Conſcience to obedience, but Gods, and mans Law bindes onely by vertue of, and for the <hi>ſake of Gods.</hi> Hence a man that breaks the juſt Laws of man, <hi>ſins againſt God,</hi> and, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> wrongs his Conſcience. As on the other hand, he that obeys an <hi>unjuſt Law</hi> of man, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Law no way warrantable by the revealed will of God, <hi>breaks Gods Law;</hi> and if his Conſcience tell him ſo, he ſins againſt his Conſcience, which always aggravates any ſin againſt God. Hence, if at any time he hath to do with any ſuch Law, he ought rather to run the hazard of mans diſpleaſure than Gods. <hi>God is to be obeyed rather than man,</hi> if one muſt be diſobeyed; and obeying God <hi>indemnifies Conſcience</hi> from the guilt of ſin in our diſobeying of man in the ſame act. So if a Law of man lies before us, which we doubt concerning the lawfulneſs of, we are here at leaſt to <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend</hi> active obedience while we ſeek for further <hi>information;</hi> for whether the thing in it ſelf be ſin or no, it's not ſo much to us at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as whether we are ſatisfied of the nature of it, and know what it is by the light of Truth ſhining in our Hearts: it will amount to ſin in us to do a <hi>doubtful action,</hi> if the Apoſtles Doctrine be true: But if the Precepts of men be found upon the beſt examination to be contrary to God's, a Chriſtian's Conſcience is the moſt certainly diſobliged, his duty lies plain before him. God's Law is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and hence it is that ſome can <hi>joyfully ſuffer</hi> all wrongs from the hands of men in the caſe of refuſal of active obedience
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:135610:18"/>unto their Laws, becauſe they are perſwaded either from a <hi>truely-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Conſcience,</hi> or from an <hi>erring;</hi> (which is binding as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent action; for a man muſt walk by that light he hath, or by none at all) that ſuch refuſal of active Obedience, and the ſufferings of theirs, is agreeable to the revealed minde of God, and therefore moſt juſtifiable at God's and Man's Tribunal.</p>
            <p>§ 6. Here will fall in a great <hi>enquiry,</hi> That although it be true that all <hi>Humane</hi> Power, both <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Executive,</hi> be limited by a ſuperiour Power, yet there's but few that have the felicity of keeping within <hi>preſcribed bounds,</hi> or having ſuch Subjects that will not be excepting againſt the Laws of their Superiours, as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to God's Laws; and this they will make the Plea for their diſobedience. Both Superiours and Inferiours will plead Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, though never ſo unrighteouſly: what ſhould be done in this caſe? Unto this <hi>Allegation</hi> many things may be ſaid; for it's ſufficiently known, that though every Law <hi>primarily</hi> requires <hi>active Obedience,</hi> yet upon a Tranſgreſſion it is ſatisfied with the due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Penalty; but for the future expects active Obedience: and a reiterated refuſal of Obedience, the Law looks upon as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous;</hi> and is really ſo, if this continuation at enmity with the Law be <hi>voluntary,</hi> and deliberate, after <hi>ſufficient Information and Conviction;</hi> And if this refuſal be conjoyn'd with reſiſtance, it is no better than Rebellion, which we explode as unwarrantable for a Chriſtian. About Preſumption we diſtinguiſh, there is that which is really ſo, and that which is onely called ſo by an unjuſt Law and miſtaking Judge. Perſiſting in refuſal of obedience after conviction of our duty, is preſumption, and a ſin againſt God, whoever the Law-maker is. But if ſuch perſiſtance be juſtified by the light of God's Law in Conſcience, it is not a preſumptuous ſin, or any ſin at all againſt God, however man may term it a preſumptuous breach of his Law: for a conſcientious Chriſtian can no more obey an unrighteous Law after ſuffering than before.</p>
            <p>§ 7. In all caſes of voluntary deliberate refuſal of active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a Law, there is, and muſt needs be, a wrong done to the Law-giver or Subject. To the Law-giver, if his Power, Law, and Ends be good, and they not anſwered; for the firſt end of every Law is, and ought to be active Obedience, as beforeſaid; the Law of God firſt obliging us ſo to the juſt Laws of man; and the end of the execution of puniſhment is for the reducing the ſufferers to active Obedience, and the exemplary reſtraint of others from Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:135610:18"/>Hence it follows, that a <hi>deliberate, reſolved, and conſtant undergoing of Suffering</hi> in this way of refuſal, is a <hi>practical</hi> charging the Magiſtrate with the higheſt Uſurpation and Tyranny in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Laws of that nature; and therefore the greateſt <hi>diſparaging te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi> born againſt his Law, a <hi>great reputation</hi> (in the judgement of the world) to the Cauſe pleaded for, let it be truth or errour, and the moſt <hi>exemplary diſappointment</hi> of the Magiſtrates Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ends, whereby others are greatly emboldened to the ſame kind of refuſal.</p>
            <p>§ 8. In all caſes where <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> abuſe their Power, they do a wrong to the ſupream Judge, in going beyond his Commiſſion, and intrenching on his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and do apparent injury to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> 1. In that an inferiour <hi>ſubordinate Law-giver</hi> hath bereaved him by a Law of thoſe juſt Liberties and Priviledges granted to him by the <hi>Charter</hi> of his ſupream <hi>Law-giver.</hi> 2. In <hi>afflicting and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> his Subject, by impoſing an unjuſt Law, and cauſing him to ſuffer by it, when he pleads exemption by a Law in full force, and a diſcharge from a <hi>higher Court,</hi> and is praiſeworthy for the ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, not to be condemned, no nor <hi>reproached</hi> as an evil doer, or <hi>preſumptuous</hi> for his permanency in <hi>non-obedience.</hi> 3. In laying his Subject under a neceſſity of <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>reiterated</hi> ſufferings, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged in Conſcience (or elſe to anſwer the default at a higher Tribunal) conſtantly to perſiſt in his refuſal to yield ſuch Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though he is to paſs under renewed and <hi>reiterated penalties;</hi> for a man to return to obedience after a <hi>deliberate ſuffering,</hi> is a viſible practical condemnation of himſelf for his <hi>former refuſal,</hi> which would greatly reflect on his honour both as a man or a Chriſtian, unleſs by the <hi>acceſs of further light</hi> he findes his Conſcience did erre, and ſo be convinced of his duty; then it becomes him both as a man and Chriſtian to retract: <hi>Humanum eſt errare, beluinum in errore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 9. Now ſeeing ſuch inevitable wrong lights ſomewhere in caſes of theſe deliberate refuſals, it will be enquired who or what muſt <hi>determine</hi> to the ſatisfaction of each party, both ſtanding highly <hi>on their Juſtification?</hi> To which I anſwer, An actual reconciliation is utterly impoſſible, <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> becauſe it will be as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter overſwaying earthly power will have it <hi>(Deo permittente)</hi> on the commanding part; his Will will carry it; <hi>Sic volo, Sic jubeo, &amp;c.</hi> and the Subject is liable to <hi>errour</hi> on his part, in <hi>Raſhneſs, Stubbornneſs, Wilfulneſs, Singularity,</hi> &amp;c. But if both parties do (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:135610:19"/>all <hi>Imperfections and Frailties</hi> attending) endeavour to approve themſelves to the King of Kings, there is a determination which to each party muſt <hi>ſatisfactorily</hi> binde, and is thus manifeſt. 1. Both are bound to the <hi>ſupream</hi> Law-giver; the one to make juſt and equal Laws, and righteouſly to diſtribute them; the other to a free <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate active obedience</hi> thereunto; both or either of which failing in their duty, ſhall be judged by the ſupream Law-giver according to the reſpective Laws whereby they are bound to the ſaid duties. 2. So long as darkneſs and corruption attends the mindes of men, there will be different apprehenſions concerning the Duties and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices they are to walk in, according to the degrees of Light recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; there will never be a perfect agreement; neither is any one mans Conſcience a <hi>Standard</hi> to another to walk by, no further than there is a concurrent <hi>emanation of convincing light</hi> from the truth to both; the Conſcience of the Magiſtrate, as ſuch, is no binding rule to the Subject, neither ought the Conſcience of the Subject to be <hi>ſwallowed up</hi> in the Magiſtrates, and thereby ſeduced to an <hi>implicite Faith.</hi> Every man is to ſee with his <hi>own Eyes,</hi> to believe with his <hi>own Faith,</hi> and act to the ſatisfaction of his <hi>own Conſcience,</hi> uſing all means for the <hi>right information</hi> of his own Minde and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the Will of God for his walking. Whatever men ſay of a <hi>Publick Conſcience,</hi> and that commands of Superiours are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to indemnifie Inferiours in all active Obedience thereto, though the Laws be evil: The Word of God knows no ſuch thing, neither will any man that is acquainted with <hi>conſcientious walking</hi> in the approvement of himſelf to God in all his ways and actions, ever give credence to any of thoſe wilde aſſertions; neither did I ever ſee any probable Argument produced to enforce thoſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the mindes of rational men, much leſs on ſuch as have their Senſes <hi>exerciſed in the knowledge of Truth.</hi> 4. Hence it will follow, that the <hi>preſent Conſcience</hi> or practical Underſtanding <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially fixed,</hi> muſt be the onely Expoſitor of Law and Duty, by which every one is bound to walk in his reſpective place that God hath ſet him in, whether Magiſtrate or Subject: whether a man be in a <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private</hi> capacity, he is to be accountable to God for all his <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>relative</hi> duties, he ſhall not be judged for either of them by another mans Conſcience. The <hi>Spirit of a man is the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. to this determination muſt the <hi>Law-giver</hi> ſtand as to the <hi>righteouſneſs or unrighteouſneſs of his Law,</hi> and the Subject as to his <hi>active or paſſive</hi> obedience: And here we ſpeak not by what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135610:19"/>meaſures <hi>Children in nonage</hi> and <hi>Fools</hi> are from infirmity of nature neceſſitated to walk, but of ſuch as have the due uſe of reaſon and underſtanding; neither can it be helped if ſome men will <hi>ſurrender themſelves</hi> and Conſciences (from ſlothfulneſs, intereſt, or flattery) to be ſlaves to men, they ſhall ſufficiently ſmart for it here, and ſeverely anſwer for it hereafter. But if any plead that men of <hi>Reaſon, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Judgement, and Conſcience,</hi> ought to quit and abandon all light and dominion of their own Conſciences, (being inferiours) and be at the diſpoſition wholly of their Superiours; this we ſay can have no ground in Nature, Politicks, or Beligion. It's juſt as if all Subjects were bound to pluck out their Eyes, and ſee onely by their Governour's. A Childe is to obey his <hi>Parent,</hi> but it is <hi>in the Lord;</hi> he is not bound to obey him in unlawful things, and ſo a Servant his Maſter: If ſuch obey their Superiours in ſuch things as the Law of God makes unlawful, in ſo doing they muſt needs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey God. Now it's moſt abſurd to think that Gods Law ſhould require it's <hi>own violation;</hi> if this Command <hi>(Children, obey your Parents)</hi> be taken without limitation, and the Parent commands the Childe to commit Idolatry, or to ſteal, and the Childe by that Precept is bound to active Obedience, then God's Law here over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws it ſelf: for by yielding obedience to one Precept, another is neceſſarily broken. We have <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s practice (and Scriptural commands) to juſtifie us in this Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Moreover, if Conſcience is to determine (after the beſt information that we can have) between <hi>God and us,</hi> as to our <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent practice,</hi> much more it's to determine in caſe of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>ſubordinate Law-givers</hi> and us. Though there is a difference in the determination, (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſuppoſing it be God's Law, his <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to make ſuch a Law is not to be <hi>diſputed</hi> by the Creature; but the queſtion or caſe of Conſcience is uſually of the meaning and extent of his Law, as to variety of practices referrable thereunto: Whereas mans Law may be diſputed whether he may <hi>de jure,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Commiſſion from God, make and enjoyn ſuch a Law) yet the Argument holds good, that in caſe of doubt about Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and Diſpute between God and us, if he requires us to be regulated by the <hi>verdict</hi> of Conſcience enlightned from the Word, then much more in ſuch caſes of diſpute betwixt Man and us: and although we may ſin in obeying the dictates of an <hi>erring Conſcience,</hi> (guided by the Word of God miſunderſtood) yet that ſin (after our impartial endeavours for information) appearing to us to be a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:135610:20"/>Duty, (though it ceaſeth not therefore to be a ſin in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) it would be a greater ſin in us to diſobey the Dictate of the preſent ſuppoſedly <hi>enlightned Conſcience,</hi> becauſe it muſt be ranked amongſt the ſins againſt Light and Conſcience; whereas now the Act is but a ſin of <hi>ignorance</hi> at worſt. Again, God will at the <hi>laſt day</hi> judge according to the Verdict of Conſcience rightly informed; <hi>If our Conſcience condemn us, God is greater,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh. Rom.</hi> 2. but if our preſent Conſcience be <hi>erring,</hi> either as to the meaning or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Law or Fact, and brings in an <hi>impartial Verdict,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it hath found upon its beſt <hi>information</hi> and enquiry; but not true (as after it appears) according <hi>to Law or Fact,</hi> its duty is to paſs again and again upon the ſame inquiſition, till it ſpeaks as it ſhall ſpeak before <hi>Gods Tribunal:</hi> So the laſt <hi>Verdict (called preſent Conſcience)</hi> ſtands binding to us, till by further light in the Law, or Evidence concerning the Fact, another be brought more agreeable to Law and Juſtice. And if upon <hi>frequent and impartial</hi> ſearch, the ſame return be ſtill made (after earneſt and ſincere ſeeking of God to diſcover our errours) it is a great confirmation unto us that it's truth that hath been ſpoken; and that we ſhould greatly ſin againſt God to ſwerve from it, what ever the Edicts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men ſay to the contrary. <hi>Magna eſt vis Conſcientiae in utram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que partem, ut neque timeant qui nihil commiſerint, &amp; poenam ſemper ante occulos verſari putent qui peccaverint.</hi> Cic. <hi>Orat. pro Milione.</hi>

            <p>§ 2.

               </gap>) both good and evil; to determine between things truely lawful and unlawful. The weak walks by a dimmer light, either by his own opinion, or tradition of his Predeceſſors, or by the example or opinion of others; and therefore more apt to fall upon ſuch actings whereby his Conſcience is wronged and defiled, by doing ſuch things as abſolutely, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially prove ſin unto him; he is as a <hi>Candle newly lighted, a bruiſed Reed, a ſmoaking Flax,</hi> ſoon extinguiſhed, or having at beſt but a ſmoaky dim light that none can walk by, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is confuſed by in his Chriſtian converſation: he is called a <hi>Babe</hi> that hath very tender Bones and Sinews, which are ſoon wrenched and put out of Joynt; hence depends ſometimes, on the guidance of others which he takes to be ſtronger than himſelf, and it may be caſts himſelf on the judgement of the blinde, and ſo they <hi>fall both together:</hi> And ſometimes preſumes to go by his own ſtrength further than he is able, whereby he is precipitated into many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, difficulties, and dangers.</p>

               </gap> is uſed there for <hi>Chriſt's receiving.</hi> As Chriſt receives them with all <hi>love, tenderneſs,</hi> and <hi>condeſcention,</hi> ſo ought every ſtronger Believer not to hurry and worry them beyond their ſtrength of Knowledge and Judgement, by rigorous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Magiſterial injunctions and compulſions; but carry them as Lambs, and gently lead them (as God <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.11. doth) by the illuminations of the Word, in the exerciſe of much <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>forbearance</hi> towards them, condeſcending in all things poſſible for their good and <hi>edification,</hi> Rom. 14.19. in whatever he may not offend Chriſt, he ought rather to pleaſe his Brother than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. As for Example, one that calls himſelf the ſtrong, (it may be he is Magiſtrate or Miniſter, and by his place ought to be ſo) ſaith it would be much more contentment to him, if one of his Subjects or Hearers would yield to conform to ſome few little things which he affirms to be but indifferent in themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Subject and Pariſhioner ſays, No, to obey you is <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi> God's own Ordinances are but little indifferent things in themſelves, but by vertue of his Commands they become <hi>great</hi> and <hi>weighty;</hi> ſo your Commands about ſmall indifferences makes them great and weighty to <hi>my Conſcience:</hi> And therefore I deſire to be excuſed in coming up to any ſuch Commands; lay aſide theſe, and I am willing to enjoy the benefit of your Communion. Suppoſe them to be <hi>meats,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135610:22"/>geſtures,</hi> or <hi>Garments,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, he ought much rather to lay aſide the preſſing of this or that indifferent thing, for the communion with, and edification of, his poor Brother: But for him to retain his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of preſſing this (as he calls it, indifferent action) on the Conſcience and practice of his Brother, not admitting any other terms of communion, and upon his refuſal to call him Heretick, Schiſmatick, Rebel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can be accounted nothing leſs than delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and ſtudiouſly to lay a <hi>Stumbling-block</hi> in his Brothers way for him to fall over; (at leaſt in the true ſence of falling) and then when he is down, to beat him and trample upon him. Secondly, In this charitable walking the Apoſtle ſaith, after they are in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion there ought not to be judging or deſpiſing each other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. The <hi>weak</hi> they are very apt to judge the <hi>ſtrong</hi> for taking too much power upon himſelf, or liberty to himſelf; and to ſay he walks not according to his Light; and that his actions are not <hi>agreeable to the rule</hi> of the Goſpel; that he is a ſcandal to Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when indeed it may be he uſeth but that lawful liberty in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things which Chriſt hath granted him, and the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not. Such judging as this is ought not to be in the weak; and remarkable it is, that the judging part is put upon the weaker ſide: the weak Chriſtian is uſually the moſt cenſorious, and many live with ſuch weakneſs as this, almoſt all their days. But the ſtrong is alſo apt to treſpaſs on the rule of Charity in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing his weak Brother, <hi>i. e.</hi> he that is ſtrong in gifts and parts, or in reſpect of place and dignity, and advantages in the world; he is apt to think ſlightly of him, and to ſpeak ſo, and call him a ſimple froward Fanatick, a man humourſome, and a contentious Fellow; a weak-brain'd Coxcomb, one that makes Conſcience and Preciſeneſs onely a pretence to carry on rebellious Deſignes againſt Church and State; and though he pretend Conſcience ſo much in ſome few things, yet he will play the Hypocrite and lie faſt enough in others. To ſuch an one the Apoſtle ſaith <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and take ſuch an one out of the huff of his Pride and Paſſion, he cannot but acknowledge that this perſon which he hath thus much contemned and deſpiſed is one truely fearing God, though he hath many weakneſſes and incongruities attending of him. Thirdly, Another piece of <hi>Charity</hi> is to <hi>help, ſuccour,</hi> and <hi>aſſiſt</hi> one another in the bearing any evil of affliction, coming out of any evil of ſin, and attaining any good deſired, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1. <hi>We that are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak;</hi> to put our Shoulders under the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:135610:23"/>burthen, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not to aggravate their weakneſs, and lay greater burthen upon them, but to help them with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts under afflictions, reſolutions in doubts, good counſel for their recovery when they are under ſin and guilt, and not pleaſe your ſelves, our pride, corrupt paſſions and affections: as ſelf muſt be denied in following Chriſt, ſo in aſſociating with his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>§ 6. We have ſpoken of the Charity the Apoſtle requires in the walking of ſtrong and weak towards one another; it remains to adde ſomething concerning the rules <hi>of Wiſdom</hi> whereby they are to walk. 1. The Strong is not to do any indifferent action which he foreſees may be a real <hi>ſinning offence</hi> unto his Brother, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19, 20, 21. It's of the greateſt tranſgreſſion of the rule of Charity in the Apoſtles ſence; and therefore it's wiſdome for the Strong to chuſe ſuch times and circumſtances for the uſe of indifferent things, as may not <hi>ſcandalize</hi> the weak, and give him occaſion either <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly to judge</hi> him, or embolden him to <hi>imitate</hi> him in an action which his own Conſcience cannot bear; for that meat which the Strong can eat <hi>without conſcience of the Idol,</hi> the Weak cannot: Therefore ſome things muſt be wiſely avoided by a Chriſtian for the ſake of another mans Conſcience in matters of indifferencies, though he findes no reaſon for it in his own. I need make no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof of this than that full place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27, 28, 29. Here the judgement of diſcretion muſt be managed by the rules of Expediency, <hi>All things that are lawful are not expedient;</hi> and if it be a ſin againſt Chriſtian Charity and Wiſdome to do that action that may really ſcandalize a weak Brother, it is much more a tranſgreſſion of a hainous nature to <hi>impoſe</hi> this action, and <hi>compel the Weak</hi> to the doing of it. 2. The wiſdom of the Weak ſhould be, to be ſo far from judging and condemning the Strong, as rather to ſuſpect his own Judgement, and lay aſide <hi>Pride, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi> and <hi>Partiality,</hi> and ſincerely endeavour after more light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſtill that it's moſt probable that a Chriſtian that hath more <hi>Knowledge, Experience, Gifts,</hi> and Parts and Advantages, may know much more than himſelf; and though he cannot reach Light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſee ſo far as to practiſe with him, yet at leaſt to believe that his ſtronger Brother hath walked according to the beſt of his light and knowledge in that thing, when he ſees no eminent moral ſwaying reaſon to the contrary. And though the Conſcience or Example of the Strong is not the rule that the Weak muſt walk by,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:135610:23"/>unleſs it's manifeſt to the Weak that the Strong walks agreeable to the Minde or Example of Chriſt: It's not any mans <hi>Place, Dignity, Learning, Piety,</hi> barely and abſolutely conſidered, that renders him a <hi>Standard</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of Chriſtian walking; yet he is to learn ſo much pious Wiſdom, as to remember all thoſe relations that he ſtands to him by, and to violate none of them upon this account, and rather come to him as a Scholar, than as a Maſter to teach him, or Judge to condemn him. It were great folly in a man that's blinde, or hath but one Eye, to condemn all men for Cheats and Knaves that have two Eyes and ſtronger ſighted than themſelves. Beſides, it's moſt agreeable to the rules of equity, that the ſtrong man ſhould be allowed the ſame liberty as to his own practice, which the weak chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth, <hi>viz.</hi> of walking by the light of his own Conſcience, be it more or leſs than anothers; though I confeſs, if there be any bar of Liberty in indifferent things in the Law of Chriſt, it's on the part of the Strong; <hi>i. e.</hi> of him that hath the <hi>over-ruling, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>exemplary</hi> power over others, for the ſake of the Weak: for that is an undoubted Law of Chriſt, that the Strong, or he that thinks or pretends himſelf ſo to be, may not do an indifferent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with offence unto the Weak. And whereas the Strong may object and ſay, that the Weak is as much bound to conform to an indifferent thing for the ſake of the Strong, as the Strong to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it for the ſake of the Weak; I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> there can be no ſin in forbearing an indifferent act to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> upon it as ſuch, when there is unavoidable ſin in doing it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that eſteems it in his Conſcience ſo to be; ſo that the reaſon is not the ſame in this kinde for the Strong and Weak. The Weak cannot walk with the Strong in all matters of indifferency, but the Strong may with the Weak by receiving of them, as the Apoſtle ſaith, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe differences; becauſe the Weak ſhould ſin in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing abſolutely indifferent which he judgeth unlawful; but the Strong doubting not the indifferency, can never think that he ſins in forbearing it, and therefore ſhould prize his Brothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion before pleaſing himſelf in ſuch actions.</p>
            <p>§ 7. The ſum of all is this, that notwithſtanding the real diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion (or ſuppoſed) between the Strong and Weak, and the diſputes in the world who is one, and who is the other, the will of Chriſt is, that they ſhould walk <hi>brotherty</hi> and <hi>inoffenſively</hi> towards each other, each one as <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>weak;</hi> as <hi>ſtrong,</hi> in reſpect of his Wiſdom and Charity; as <hi>weak,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Humility; Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:135610:24"/>and <hi>Suſpicion</hi> of himſelf, <hi>Every one eſteeming another better than himſelf;</hi> for the ſame Chriſtian may be <hi>ſtrong and weak;</hi> ſtrong in the knowledge and experience of ſome Truths, and in reſpect of ſome Temptations, weak in his apprehenſion and judgement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſtrong at one time, and weak at another: And beſides, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending infirmities muſt be conſidered on both parts; for it cannot be but ſometimes it will fall out, that the Weak will manifeſt his weakneſs, by <hi>Peeviſhneſs, Prejudice, Paſſion,</hi> or <hi>Bewraying</hi> his manifeſt ignorance, for which the Strong is not to deſpiſe him or reject him, but rather help him under this burthen, and endeavour to win him nearer unto him by a ſpirit of forbearance and meekneſs; for men in manifeſt weakneſſes are to be pitied and ſupported, not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted over and trampled upon. So the <hi>Strong</hi> will ſometimes ſhew his ſtrength (though it be his ſin, and therefore a weakneſs rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) in doing actions indifferent to himſelf, and it may be knows not, or conſiders not, that they are ſinning offences unto his weak Brother; and then for his own vindication, with too great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of height and vehemency, next door to Pride and Paſſion, (too often the things themſelves) manageth his caſe for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or conviction of the Weak, the good effect whereof is loſt by reaſon of the attending corruption. Here prevailing Grace in the Weak will turn the ſcales, and make him appear the Strong, if he ſuppreſs the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

            <p>§ 8. How contrary then is the walking of ſome unto this Rule? when the Strong will binde up the Weak by humane Laws to do all thoſe actions (that to him are indifferent) under pain of non-communion, or other penalties, when he regards no more the ſtrength of the Childe that he is to walk with, as that it muſt run as faſt as himſelf, or rather drive it before him, not conſidering the weakneſs of his parts manifeſtly wronged, and the great hazard of his life: how unlike he is to God in this, and how contrary he acts to his revealed will, let the impartial judge. On the other hand, when the Weak, at leaſt in knowledge, if not in power, will binde up the hands of the Strong by ſome Law humane, under pain of inevitable bodily Sufferings, or Cenſures publick or private, to deny his own
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:135610:24"/>Light and Liberty, and come down to his Darkneſs and Bondage; it's as when a blinde man will not be ſatisfied unleſs all other mens Eyes be put out too; and the lame, till other mens Legs be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. This is Tyranny on both hands; Chriſt never ſubſtituted one Chriſtian as ſuch a Law-giver unto another in Spirituals: and they that pretend to it as ſtrong, to give Law to the weak; or as weak, to give Law to limit and binde up the ſtrong, they are ſo far from the Rules of the Goſpel, that whatever their profeſſion is of Faith in the greater or leſſer meaſure, I fear it will hardly be found in the ſmalleſt portion in either of them; and therefore from this conſideration will ariſe a neceſſary diſtinction between the ſtrong or weak ſincere Believer, and between the ſtrong and weak hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or pretended Believer.</p>
            <p>§ 9. What hath been hitherto ſpoken moſtly concerns the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtrong or weak ſincere Chriſtian; we ſhall ſpeak a word of the Hypocritical pretenders of both ſorts. The <hi>hypocritically</hi> Strong, is he that apprehends himſelf to be ſo, and from ſpiritual Pride and corrupt Intereſt, puts on a <hi>phariſaical</hi> Vizard, whereby he would perſwade others that he is ſo; one that thinketh he knoweth much, and <hi>knoweth nothing as he ought to know,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.2. and he ſo thinks of himſelf, as that <hi>he is puffed up,</hi> v. 1. And again the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Not he that commendeth himſelf is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.19. his knowledge is not of the right ſtamp, it's ſeparated from undoubted concomitants of ſanctified <hi>Knowledge, Charity, Humility,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Wiſdom,</hi> and inſtead thereof he manifeſts himſelf with oſtentation, Lords it tyrannically over the Conſciences of others, be they ſtrong or weak; deſpiſing and contemning them in all their doubts, rather deſiring to confound them with difficulties, and impoſe on them by compulſions, than any way to inform their Judgements, or to win them to his ſociety by condeſcention and meekneſs.</p>
            <p>§ 10. The weak Hypocritical Profeſſor little differs from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, not in <hi>kinde,</hi> but in <hi>degree</hi> onely; for a Hypocrite is but ſo ſtill, be he weak or ſtrong; <hi>i. e.</hi> have more or leſs parts or advantages to hide and conceal himſelf, and ſet off himſelf to the world; but he differs from the ſuppoſed ſtrong Chriſtian, in that he hath but little knowledge, a few gifts and parts, and is not able to manage his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to ſo much advantage for the deceiving of others, but yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends highly to Conſcience, and the pureſt ways of holineſs, and pleads himſelf to be weak onely for a Bulwark for himſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:135610:25"/>his Errours, Singularity and Cenſoriouſneſs of others, againſt all the inſtructions and admonitions, whatever forcible arguments and reaſons they bring with them: He will ſtill ſay, truly this is his weak judgement, and that he is but of a <hi>mean capacity,</hi> and cannot underſtand what you have to ſay for his <hi>information</hi> and <hi>conviction;</hi> and if you make him underſtand, he will ſtill hold his Concluſion, though his Premiſes be manifeſted to be never ſo weak.</p>
            <p>§ 11. The ſincere ought to have a watchful eye upon theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, endeavouring to diſcover them, for at firſt they cannot, and therefore are called <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> becauſe they can obſcure and conceal themſelves from man for a while; and when they are not known, the ſincere is bound to carry himſelf towards them by the ſame rules as he doth to thoſe that are equally ſincere with himſelf: but when he is once diſcovered, he hath no reaſon then to carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards him as towards a ſincere, but as towards a <hi>falſe-hearted Profeſſor.</hi> But we ſhould be very wary of judging men <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> it's the greateſt cenſure in the world upon a <hi>Profeſſor;</hi> there muſt be very great evidence for it before we can conclude it ſo: for Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie is properly in the eye of none but God; and though Chriſt (who knew men throughout) called them as they were, I queſtion whether his Example may be followed in this, by the beſt men on earth. But we may have great grounds of ſuſpicion of this by their fruits, and accordingly we are to be directed in our carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them by the Word of God, and we have our Saviour's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to the Phariſees, whether ſtrong or weak, for our example, ſo far as imitable by us. Our Saviour would never gratifie that ſort of men, whatever ſhape they appeared under, either of weak or ſtrong; and notwithſtanding all their gloſing pretentions, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells them, their Hearts were rotten and their ends wicked; and by two eminent characters of this nature he diſcovers them to the world. 1. That they were mighty zealous for ſome ſmall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial matters in Religion, and profeſſed Enemies to the <hi>purer</hi> and more <hi>weighty</hi> part wherein the power of Godlineſs lay, <hi>Faith, Juſtice, Charity,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That they cried up Humane Laws, Traditions and Conſtitutions in the worſhip of God, above the Laws and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God himſelf. The carriage of <hi>Paul</hi> alſo in this kinde is very remarkable, that he would not (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5.) yield to the <hi>circumciſion</hi> of <hi>Titus,</hi> it being ſought for by falſe Brethren that would have compelled it, and endeavoured to betray the Churches <hi>liberty,</hi> and bring them into bondage; to whom (he ſaith) we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135610:25"/>gave no place by <hi>ſubjection, (i. e.</hi> yielding to their impoſition) no not <hi>for an hour,</hi> that the <hi>truth of the Goſpel</hi> (i. e. <hi>true Goſpel-liberty</hi>) might continue with you; whereas before he yielded to the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of</hi> Timothy to gratifie the weak real Believers. Whence it plainly follows, that whoever they be that endeavour to enthral our Conſciences and Practices, though in matters in themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, are not to be yielded to as weak, nor ſubjected to as ſtrong, but rejected as falſe Brethren. 2. The <hi>ſtrong ſincere Chriſtian</hi> is not to <hi>violate</hi> any <hi>poſitive</hi> Law of Chriſt that he is in his Conſcience perſwaded of, to gratifie the <hi>weak,</hi> or any perſons whatever, Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, Superiours, or Equals; all the <hi>conceſſion</hi> muſt be onely in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in themſelves <hi>indifferent;</hi> neither ſhould the <hi>weak</hi> offer violence to his Conſcience in any thing to pleaſe the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> and <hi>wiſeſt</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in the world.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:135610:26"/>carries the nature of a ſcandal with it, and thoſe we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh according to degrees: There are the <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> that hazard falling; and there are thoſe of a <hi>leſſer nature,</hi> that hazard ſtumbling onely. They differ onely in <hi>degree,</hi> or in <hi>reſpect</hi> that they have to our <hi>ſtate</hi> or <hi>particular actions</hi> and concerns. Some of more dangerous conſequence, and ſome of leſs. Some are more eaſily removed out of the way, ſome more permanent and laſting. As if there be any difference in thoſe expreſſions, <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling,</hi> and <hi>rock of offence,</hi> it lieth in that the offending <hi>Stone</hi> is eaſily put aſide, but the <hi>Rock</hi> is immovable.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Offences are ſaid alſo to be either ſuch as are given and not taken; and in this ſence ſome places muſt be taken, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.23. when Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Thou art an offence to me, in endeavouring by thy advice and evil counſel to turn me out of the courſe of exerciſing my Mediators office: Not that Chriſt was ſtumbled, but there was ſuch a thing in the nature of <hi>Peter</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in relation to Chriſt's work that he had to do. Some offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are taken and not given; <hi>i. e.</hi> it's not in the nature of them to be offences, but by reaſon of the corruptions of men by their abuſe of the greateſt good, it often becomes a ſcandal to them; ſo Chriſt himſelf was a <hi>ſcandal</hi> to the Jews, and <hi>a Rock of ſcandal,</hi> as well as a Stone of ſtumbling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, when he went preaching about, were ſcandalized at him and at his Doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.6. <hi>ch.</hi> 15.12. <hi>ch.</hi> 26.31. This is a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſcandal to him that is <hi>offended.</hi> Thus the doing of the moſt juſtifiable action may undergo the diſreputation of an offence, when men will either perverſly call good evil, or interpret it as evilly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or by reaſon of ignorance and weakneſs of judgement judge it ſo: and thus Chriſt himſelf, and no marvel if the beſt of his Members be not a ſcandal many times in their moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ways of walking, unto the men of the world, yea unto many weaker Believers, their <hi>liberty becomes a Stumbling-block</hi> to the weak, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. and a <hi>mans good is blaſphemed, or evil ſpoken of,</hi> Rom. 14.16. there are many that will be offended captiouſly and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they are the profane men of the world that call Chriſt <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi> and his Diſciples no better, or the <hi>phariſaical</hi> Profeſſors. The Diſciples told Chriſt, Knoweſt thou not that the Phariſees were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended when they heard theſe ſayings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.12. Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>That every plant that his Father had not planted ſhould be rooted up: Let them alone, they are blinde,</hi> &amp;c. therefore, no marvel if they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:135610:26"/>bark at the Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe unjuſt and <hi>unreaſonable offence-takers</hi> are the greateſt <hi>offence-givers,</hi> who do truely offend Gods Children in all ſences more than the prophane world: ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.60, 61.</p>
            <p>§ 3. An <hi>offence given,</hi> is when a man or thing hath an innate juſt ground of ſcandal, by <hi>relation to the moral Law,</hi> and is no other than ſin or ſinful <hi>per ſe &amp; in ſe,</hi> whatever other mens opinion of it be; and therefore works objectively upon others by way of <hi>ſtumbling</hi> and <hi>ſcandalizing;</hi> and they are two ſorts on whom it operates this way: Either thoſe that behold this action with <hi>approbation;</hi> and they ſtumble, or rather fall, in the worſt manner thereby; for they thereby are <hi>encouraged</hi> to fall into ſin, or to <hi>remain</hi> in ſin, by reaſon of it, becauſe of the great inducements that they take up from the perſon committing it, his <hi>Holineſs, Wiſdom, Authority, Age,</hi> &amp;c. or thoſe that behold it are <hi>grieved</hi> at it, and at the perſon offending, ſo as to cenſure his Perſon or Religion, and provoked by ſome ways or means to manifeſt their great <hi>diſguſt,</hi> not onely to the perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, but even to the world. Hence I diſtinguiſh Offences into <hi>Grieving</hi> and <hi>Sinning,</hi> or <hi>Grief-cauſing offences,</hi> or <hi>Sin-cauſing offences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. Of the <hi>grieving Offence</hi> firſt; and it's that which tends to the afflicting and troubling the <hi>Mindes,</hi> Hearts, and Conſciences of the Faithful in their Chriſtian courſe; and the offending party ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrongs and injures by acts of violence and oppreſſion, whereby he <hi>grieves</hi> the oppreſſed; or elſe he does and perſiſts in ſuch actions as the offended judge <hi>unlawful:</hi> And therefore from true principles of the love of God and his Brother, and the hatred of ſin, he is much grieved, and walks heavily to ſee his <hi>Brother walk diſorderly,</hi> and complains of this block laid in the way of his <hi>Charity and Chriſtian Communion,</hi> Rom. 14.15. If thy Brother be grieved (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) with thy meat, thou walkeſt not charitably.</p>
            <p>§ 5. There be two ſorts of <hi>grieving Offences.</hi> 1. All <hi>abſolutely unlawful actions</hi> that are ſeen by the offended party to be ſins by Chriſt's Law, and theſe he is bound by Chriſt's Law to be offended at, and at the perſons committing them, as not onely ſinners againſt God, but againſt the Members of Chriſt; and ſuch offenders are the prophane men of the world or Phariſaical Profeſſors, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. <hi>chap.</hi> 18.7. the world is full of theſe offences, and miſerable and woful by reaſon of them. 2. All actions that though they are lawful in themſelves, yet <hi>circumſtantially</hi> reſpected according to time and place, they have an unexpediency, and therefore carry an offenſiveneſs with them, or they become offences by the ſiniſter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:135610:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>interpretation of the offended, and then are not juſtly taken: all <hi>things</hi> indeed <hi>are pure, but it is evil for that man that eateth with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> Rom. 14.20. and though the offence may be but a reputed or ſuppoſed one (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) by the offended party, yet it may be really given by the <hi>offending</hi> party, and the offence be unjuſtly taken as to the thing or action, yet it may be juſt and equal as to the <hi>party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> who is as well acquainted with the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of his Brother, as the <hi>indifferency</hi> of the action.</p>
            <p>§ 6. The <hi>ſinning offence</hi> is ſuch a thing or action in one man, that becomes an <hi>occaſion of ſin</hi> in another, whether it work upon him by way of <hi>Example, Advice, Compulſion,</hi> &amp;c. if it force or allure him into ſin, it's a ſcandal, and of the groſſeſt and moſt hainous nature; and a man is offended here many times, when he is pleaſed as to the carnal part, as he always ſeems to be when they cloſe with him by way of encouragement, becauſe ſinning is moſt properly ſpiritual ſtumbling and falling, and thoſe things that occaſion it are <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically</hi> called <hi>Traps, Gins, Snares, Stumbling-blocks,</hi> in Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe; and in that ſence is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> moſt frequently uſed. This <hi>Scandal,</hi> or occaſion of falling into ſin, is diverſly taken; it's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſcribed unto Gods judicial proceeding with the ſons of men, when he lays ſuch Providences before them which he knows will become a ſcandal by reaſon of their corruptions, <hi>viz.</hi> of further more viſible and exemplary ſinning unto them, <hi>Ezeek.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.21. in this ſence Chriſt became a <hi>ſinning ſcandal</hi> unto a great part of the world: To the <hi>Jews,</hi> a <hi>Stumbling-block,</hi> and to the <hi>Greeks, Fooliſhneſs.</hi> The ſufferings and falls of Gods people, intended for the <hi>humbling, proving,</hi> and <hi>doing good</hi> unto them, have their <hi>bardning effects</hi> upon the wicked: The ſame <hi>Sun-beams harden the Clay, and ſoften the Wax; Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis.</hi> Many Creature-comforts uſed by ſome for nouriſhment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of life, become no better than Poyſon unto others by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate and ſinful abuſe of them, and are called a <hi>Snare, Trap, Gin, Scandal,</hi> Rom. 11.9. It's attributed to any ſubtile <hi>enticement</hi> or <hi>inſinuation</hi> to the commitment of ſin, either of our own inherent Luſts and Affections, <hi>James</hi> 1. and in this ſence the <hi>right Eye,</hi> or <hi>Hand</hi> is ſaid to <hi>ſcandalize</hi> us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.29. and 18.9. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.47. Or it's taken for another's <hi>inſinuations</hi> or allurements to ſin, by Words or Actions, by <hi>Words and Perſwaſions;</hi> that of <hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.23. By alluring Actions and Practices: ſo <hi>Balac laid a Scandal before the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14. Moreover,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:135610:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>it's attributed to any thing ſinfully hurtful, or as a fruit of ſin, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious</hi> unto man, eſpecially all ſinful incorrigible men; all which ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals <hi>Chriſts Angels</hi> ſhall gather out at the end thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. But the uſe of the word moſtly in our ſence, is ſuch a kinde of <hi>Stumbling-block</hi> as one Brother may put in <hi>another's way;</hi> or more largely, ſuch a kinde of Stumbling-block as is an occaſion of <hi>ſinning to any of Chriſt's Members.</hi> 1. Such as is laid by the malicious World and Phariſees, who are plotting and contriving entrappers of Gods people, like <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Balack,</hi> and rejoyce over them as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies when they have brought any of thoſe little ones into ſin; our Saviour's Wo belongs to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.6. 2. When one Believer <hi>offends</hi> another, the <hi>ſtrong</hi> doing an action (to him indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent) whereby the weak by miſunderſtanding becomes ſeduced to, and entrapped, or eſtabliſhed in ſin.</p>
            <p>§ 7. There are theſe ways whereby the <hi>indifferent act</hi> of the Strong becomes a <hi>ſinning ſcandal</hi> unto the Weak. 1. When it encourageth the Weak to an <hi>implicite Faith,</hi> taken upon the practice of the Strong (<hi>i. e.</hi> of one eminent for <hi>Grace, Gifts, Exemplary ſufferings,</hi> or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of dignity and truſt) to do thoſe things which he doubts to be lawful and warrantable <hi>by the Word of God,</hi> and then this weak Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is condemned in Conſcience (not abſolutely dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as ſome underſtand the uſe of that ambiguous word in the tranſlation) the reaſon added is demonſtration enough, becauſe <hi>whatever is not of Faith is ſin,</hi> and all ſin condemns by a <hi>concomitant or ſubſequent</hi> guilt attending. 2. When the actions of the ſtrong, lawful in his performance of them, is a <hi>confirmation</hi> of the weak in his unlawful practice of the ſame thing, as in the Apoſtles inſtance of <hi>eating things ſacrificed to Idols:</hi> The ſtrong eats it as other meat, without any conſcience of, or reſpect to the <hi>Idol;</hi> but the weak is confirmed in his idolatrous or ſuperſtitious uſe of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. and the ſame thing being but an indifferent lawful action to one; is <hi>Superſtition or Idolatry</hi> to the other, eating with ſome reſpect to the Idol, or with a Conſcience checking upon that conſideration; and ſo their <hi>Conſcience being weak is defiled</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> becomes accuſing of ſin, and therefore polluted with guilt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12.) but meat <hi>commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us not to God,</hi> v. 8. <hi>i. e.</hi> an indifferent thing in it ſelf, we are never the worſe for it, provided no ſinful circumſtances do attend it; but take heed leſt your meat (<hi>i. e.</hi> an indifferent thing) and your liberty in the uſe of it, <hi>become not a ſcandal,</hi> i. e. <hi>an occaſion of ſin to the weak:</hi> For <hi>if any that is weak ſee thee which haſt knowledge ſit at
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:135610:28"/>meat in an Idol-temple,</hi> (and think that thy carriage be with ſome civil or religious reſpect) <hi>ſhall not ſuch a mans Conſcience be embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened?</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>or edified?</hi> i. e. confirmed in his Judgement and practice in eating ſuch things.

There is alſo a neceſſity in them, and <hi>Neceſſarium, quando ſemper verum eſt, nec falſum eſſe poteſt,</hi> when the Axiome affirmed is always true, and never can be falſe; to this is oppoſed a <hi>contingency,</hi> which indeed is a <hi>medium</hi> between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood,</hi> as <hi>Indifferency</hi> is between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and is an Axio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical indifferency properly, as the other is moral; and thoſe things that are <hi>contingent</hi> are indifferently concerned in the rules of Art to <hi>Truth or Falſhood.

            <p>§ 7. Things have a <hi>Neceſſity of nature</hi> in them, when they are ſo ordained of God the Creator of all things, that they ſhould be, or do this or that to the compleating their being or welbeing, in order to the accompliſhment of that end for which he firſt introduced them; and his command unto them (the proper catholick rule of every art) ſo to be and do, is the <hi>law of nature</hi> which all natural agents under the conduct of reſpective Arts and Sciences do receive, <hi>viz.</hi> what they ſhould be, what they ſhould do, and to what end they ſhould tend; all which are undiſpenſable <hi>(rebus ſecundum natucam aut regulas artis, poſitis)</hi> and unalterable by any but God alone; and they are his <hi>Ordinances</hi> for the rule of <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> &amp;c. given by God, and cannot depart from before him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.35, 36. <gap reason="foreign">

As a man may be Tall, or Short, Fat, or Lean; of a fair or black Complexion: So a Sheep, black, or white. It may Rain or be fair Weather on this or that day.

            <p>§ 8. Things or Actions are <hi>politically neceſſary, or indifferent,</hi> when they become neceſſary by ſubjection to ſome Law of <hi>Polity,</hi> or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent by being void of limitation by that Law. <hi>Political Neceſſities and Indifferences</hi> are either <hi>Civil or Eccleſiaſtical: Civilly neceſſary</hi> are either when the things or actions themſelves have an innate tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the order of civil Societies, or the exerciſe of diſtributive or commutative juſtice, flowing from the influence of the moral Law diffuſing itſelf through all natural Conſciences, and becoming the very <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Sinews</hi> of Societies; or when according to the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> or <hi>prudential arbitrament</hi> of the civil Magiſtrate (agreeing to the conſtitution of the Government) a <hi>civil Law</hi> is enacted, where it bindes, is <hi>civilly neceſſary,</hi> and that which it leaves unbound is <hi>civilly indifferent,</hi> and neither good nor evil in reſpect of that Law. Unto this Head may be referred <hi>Oeconomical neceſſities</hi> and indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of which we may have ſome ſuch analogical underſtanding which I ſhall not now ſtay upon.</p>
            <p>§ 9. Some things and actions fall under a <hi>ſpiritual political</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and are <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> pertaining to <hi>inſtituted Worſhp,</hi> to the Government and Diſcipline of Chriſt's <hi>Body-politick,</hi> which is his Church, and theſe are <hi>Levitical</hi> or <hi>Evangelical.

            </p>
            <p>§ 10. Things or actions <hi>Evangelically Eccleſiaſtical</hi> are alſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> or <hi>indifferent.</hi> Neceſſary, when they have a <hi>determination</hi> of <hi>political good or evil</hi> laid on them by the Law of Chriſt, for the management of the affairs of his Church under the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Things in reſpect to the Church-conſtitutions are alſo <hi>indifferent,</hi> when they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Law of Chriſt to be of any neceſſary concernment to the being or well-being of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Polity.</hi> All Eccleſiaſtical Inſtitutions are founded on the Moral Law, but are diſtinguiſhed from the Moral Precepts by the name of <hi>Inſtituted Worſhip;</hi> becauſe God ordained the <hi>Moral Law</hi> to be a rule of Obedience under all the ages of his Church; but Chriſt hath reſerved to himſelf the

This laſt change of inſtituted Worſhip we are under, and it ſtands conſtituted by the Laws of his own <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation</hi> by himſelf <hi>immediately</hi> when here on earth, and by his Apoſtles after his Aſcention inſpired with his Spirit, extraordinarily <hi>commiſſionated</hi> by his Authority.

            </head>
            <p>§ 1. HAving thus briefly deſcribed and unfolded all ſorts of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities</hi> and <hi>Indifferences</hi> requiſite to our purpoſe, and ranked them to ſeveral Heads, that we might not be miſtaken in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe when we ſpeak of any of them diſtinct from the other; We judge it now convenient in the firſt place, before we come to argue the matter in controverſie, to lay down a few <hi>general</hi> Propoſitions to the intelligent Reader, whereby the nature of theſe things will further and more clearly appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No created beings or actions had any thing of moral neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or indifferency <hi>antecedent</hi> to a moral Law: for <hi>where there is no Law,</hi> things cannot reſpect it as good or evil; and if the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams cannot be without a Law, neither can the middle be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſaid Law; and if ſome things are not made morally good or evil by commanding or forbidding, other things cannot be morally indifferent as to good or evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though things have no indifferency <hi>antecedaneous</hi> to a Law, and without reſpect thereto, yet they have a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of neceſſary <hi>goodneſs, evil,</hi> or <hi>indifferency;</hi> and thoſe things that are <hi>good or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:135610:31"/>evil</hi> by one Law, may be left <hi>indifferent</hi> by another, <hi>&amp; vice verſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſame Law that ordains things or actions <hi>neceſſarily good or evil,</hi> doth <hi>excluſivè &amp; implicitè</hi> determine things <hi>indifferent</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to its ſelf; for ſuch things as are neither <hi>commanded or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,</hi> are neither <hi>good or evil,</hi> and therefore may be done or not done without ſin, being <hi>indifferent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There is none can looſe or abſolve from a <hi>binding Law,</hi> but he that hath the <hi>Legiſlative power,</hi> or one <hi>ſuperiour to him;</hi> men may by alteration of Statutes, change their <hi>neceſſities</hi> into <hi>indifferences, &amp; vice verſa;</hi> or God by his ſupremacy may do this in mans Laws, but no man can aboliſh God's Laws, or make new ones of the ſame kinde by changing things that he hath left <hi>indifferent</hi> into <hi>neceſſities,</hi> it is his <hi>Prerogative</hi> onely.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All appearances of things to be what they really are not, by the ſeveral reſpects they have to the Law they are under, are <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>hallucinations</hi> of the Underſtanding; for <hi>good</hi> ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>evil good; neceſſary</hi> things <hi>indifferent,</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> things <hi>neceſſary:</hi> And though our walking muſt be and can be but according to the <hi>illumination</hi> of our Underſtanding, yet doth not our <hi>Judgement</hi> or <hi>Conſciences</hi> alter the true reſpect that things have in themſelves.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All religious actions, as ſuch, practically circumſtantiated, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>ceremonial,</hi> are <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> and cannot be called <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> unleſs in an <hi>abſtract</hi> conſideration from all <hi>religious reſpects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Abſolute <hi>good and evil</hi> are not of the ſame extent with <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>unlawful;</hi> for an <hi>indifferent action</hi> is <hi>lawful</hi> which hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination by a Law to <hi>good or evil,</hi> becauſe not onely the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but even the <hi>permiſſion</hi> of the Law makes a <hi>licitum,</hi> but it's onely the Prohibition that makes it unlawful. Hence indifferent things are not <hi>media inter Licita &amp; illicita,</hi> for they are <hi>contradicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and indifferent things are <hi>licita,</hi> and upon that account referred to the Law, and confirms that indifferent things cannot be ſaid to be ſo but in reference to ſome Law, <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> being an eſſential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of an <hi>indifferent</hi> thing.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To ſay that an <hi>indifferent thing</hi> is a mean between commanded and forbidden, is all one as to ſay it is a mean between <hi>good and evil;</hi> for there is nothing <hi>good or evil,</hi> but by vertue of ſomething carrying the force of a Law in it, that by a <hi>Command or Prohibition</hi> puts the nature of good or evil upon it correſpondent to the ſaid Law: As the Law of the Creation makes things <hi>naturally</hi> good or evil, the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:135610:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>Law <hi>moral</hi> makes them <hi>morally</hi> ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that which is <hi>prohibited</hi> as not anſwering the ends of the one or other, is neceſſarily <hi>evil.</hi> That which is commanded as anſwering the ends, and <hi>requiſite,</hi> is <hi>good neceſſarily.</hi> That which in itſelf may or may not anſwer, and is not abſolutely <hi>commanded or forbidden,</hi> is neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil,</hi> (in reſpect of that Law, though it may be in reſpect of another) and therefore <hi>indifferent.</hi>

               </gap> 1. It's taken for a <hi>Liberty</hi> from ſins dominion, which is a tranſgreſſion of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18, 22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. 2. It's oppoſed to the bondage of <hi>expectation of Juſtification</hi> by the works of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22, to the 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.3. Now <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> as it reſpects indifferent things, it flows from the Law of Chriſt two ways, either by way of releaſe from the <hi>bondage</hi> of ſome Law, by the <hi>repeal</hi> of it, as of the Ceremonial Law, which conſiſted in many <hi>obſervations of Days, Meats, Habits,</hi> and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:135610:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>many <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and is <hi>liberatio;</hi> or by allowing us and entruſting us with a <hi>Latitude</hi> in the uſe of many things, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all <hi>ſupervening Laws</hi> and impoſitions, and therefore this is that Liberty which we are commanded by Chriſt to maintain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. we are to take heed that we <hi>be not entangled again in the Yoak of bondage;</hi> that place is comprehenſive of all the <hi>Liberty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed</hi> for us by Chriſt, in reſpect of the <hi>moral</hi> and all <hi>ceremonial Laws;</hi> and ſo far as we have a Liberty by <hi>Goſpel-charter,</hi> we are to ſtand faſt in it, avoiding all re-intanglements of Conſcience by the Children of men, that <hi>ſpy out our lawful Liberties,</hi> and would deprive us of them; <hi>Ye are bought with a price, be ye not the ſervants of men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. which place muſt be underſtood in <hi>religious ſervice,</hi> ſuch as is done in obedience to the <hi>immediate commands</hi> of Chriſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>v.</hi> 22, and 24. for Chriſt doth not prohibit <hi>ſervice to men</hi> in <hi>Domeſtick and Civil affairs,</hi> but a flavery to the wills of men in the matters of Religion and <hi>inſtituted Worſhip;</hi> be ye not <hi>time-ſervers</hi> or <hi>men-ſervers:</hi> So that by Chriſt's Law we are bound to refuſe homage to mens Uſurpations in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>§ 2. As what Chriſt's Law to us determines (for our practice) to good and evil in all things and actions comprehended under that Law is definite; ſo what he hath not there determined ſome way or other, either <hi>explicitely or implicitely,</hi> is <hi>indefinite,</hi> and a Chriſtian hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Liberty to do or to forbear without ſin, as in ſuch matters as relate to <hi>religious obſervations</hi> in Meats, Drinks, Days, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending inſtituted Worſhip, not commanded or forbidden by Chriſt, but are left by Chriſt to our <hi>Liberty</hi> to do or not to do by the judgement of <hi>diſcretion,</hi> as it hath moſt tendency to the <hi>glory of God</hi> and edification of our ſelves and others: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; to ſit or ſtand in hearing the Word, to kneel or ſtand, or lie proſtrate in Prayer; for a man to turn his face to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt,</hi> or wear this or that <hi>Colour</hi> in the Worſhip of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thouſands of inſtances may be given. We ſpeak not here of <hi>natural, civil,</hi> or <hi>moral</hi> Liberty; there's no doubt but a Chriſtian as a man may claim as much of that as another, and hath as much Law-obligation as to precepts of practice; but the matter under debate is what the <hi>Evangelical Liberty</hi> of a Chriſtian is in the tranſaction of the affairs of Chriſt's Kingdom.</p>
            <p>§ 3. A <hi>Chriſtian's Liberty</hi> is not a <hi>boundleſs and lawleſs Liberty</hi> in thoſe things wherein he is moſt free, but hath its ſpecial limits and bounds ſet unto it by Chriſt, in certain Rules and Precepts generally
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:135610:32"/>preſcribed by him, to which all his actions may be reduced, either as to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of them, and ſo fall directly under that Law; or to the general <hi>circumſtances,</hi> and ſo are ſubject more remotely. Hence there are no actions that a Chriſtian doth of religious concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that are <hi>compleatly indifferent,</hi> but hath <hi>aliquatenus rationem bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni aut mali.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. The Spirit of God (if I miſtake not) ſets a double bound to <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> viz. <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Evangelical.</hi> 1. <hi>Moral,</hi> in that Chriſts Law allows none the liberty of committing <hi>moral tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;</hi> it owns, ratifies, and confirms all moral <hi>Precepts, Prohibitions,</hi> or <hi>Permiſſions,</hi> and none may uſe <hi>Chriſtian Liberty as occaſion of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs,</hi> Gal. 5.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. 2. The <hi>Evangelical bound</hi> to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in matters left by Chriſt indifferent, is <hi>Expediency,</hi> by which a thing that is ſubſtantially <hi>indifferent</hi> may be relatively and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially <hi>neceſſary, pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and becomes <hi>bonum aut malum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingens aut reſpectivum,</hi> and that is <hi>medium officium,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when a thing lawful in itſelf becomes unlawful: the rule is plain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23, 28, 29. therefore, 1. All actions, and therefore <hi>indifferent,</hi> muſt be directed to the great and general moral end of <hi>Gods Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. a man may eat or drink, or wear this or that thing indifferently, ſo that it be to God's glory; keep a day, or not keep it; chuſe this or that time to pray in for the ſame ends. And hence Election is to be made of <hi>indifferencies</hi> according to their more or leſs <hi>tendency</hi> or <hi>aptneſs</hi> to accompliſh that great end. 2. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond end, but <hi>ſubordinate,</hi> in expediency to be reſpected, is <hi>edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our ſelves or others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. and that which reſpects neither of theſe ends with at leaſt ſome tendency, is <hi>religiouſly vain,</hi> as wearing one colour more than another religiouſly in the worſhip of God, and in one part of worſhip more than another; what doth this conduce to <hi>edification,</hi> by which way, if any, it ſhould be ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to God's glory? and to bring <hi>vain oblations</hi> to God in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is abominable to him in all ages of the Church.</p>
            <p>§ 5. God hath not by Laws determined particularly all the caſes of a <hi>Chriſtians Converſation,</hi> but left many to the management of the judgement of diſcretion by the rules of <hi>expediency,</hi> which is a skill of diſcerning between <hi>good and evil,</hi> Heb. 5.12. and between <hi>good and better. Diſcretion is the higheſt pitch of practical Judgement,</hi> which although it be guided by general rules for attaining the great end, yet it takes its particular meaſures very much from former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and the ſight of various <hi>circumſtances</hi> and <hi>occurrences,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135610:33"/>it judgeth what may be more or leſs expedient in all actions; and though in themſelves they are indifferently <hi>referrable</hi> this way or that way, yet by that time they are reduced into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice by a Chriſtian's ſpiritual Reaſon and Diſcretion, acting from ſenſes exerciſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. there is manifeſt <hi>good or evil</hi> at leaſt <hi>relative</hi> diſcovered in them, or at leaſt put upon them by the ſaid ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ends and rules of walking.</p>
            <p>§ 6. As <hi>ſtrength</hi> appears moſt in the management of a man's ſelf according to the rules and obſervances of diſcretion, ſo <hi>weakneſs</hi> in the failure hereof is moſt diſcoverable; and by an <hi>accumulation</hi> of theſe little failures, a Chriſtian doth exceedingly <hi>miſcarry,</hi> and Profeſſion becomes very much diſparaged.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Hence <hi>indifferent actions</hi> may become <hi>offending, grieving,</hi> and <hi>ſcandalizing</hi> unto others, by reaſon of ſome <hi>external accident, temporal or local reſpect,</hi> and ſo may be unlawful by the rules of <hi>expediency;</hi> for that which certainly is not <hi>expedient,</hi> is <hi>unlawful,</hi> though degrees are to be admitted in this caſe.</p>
            <p>§ 8. As the <hi>ſcandalizing</hi> others is a miſchief that makes an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent action <hi>unexpedient,</hi> ſo alſo the betraying our <hi>own Liberty. Paul</hi> in his acting kept a watchful eye here: when he found that ſome deſigned by an indifferent thing to bring him into bondage, he gave not the leaſt place to them, as in the matter of the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> of <hi>Titus,</hi> Gal. 2.3, 4. We are to ſtand faſt in our Liberty, and not to be <hi>enthral'd</hi> in bondage, though it be but by the doing an action in itſelf <hi>adiaphorous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 9. <hi>Whatever is not of Faith is ſin,</hi> and the neceſſity of every <hi>action</hi> or <hi>forbearance</hi> muſt appear to every mans Conſcience, that he may do or forbear believingly in all <hi>religious concernments;</hi> therefore all abſolute neceſſities muſt be bound on his Conſcience by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome Law poſitively <hi>commanding</hi> or <hi>forbidding.</hi> And all <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative neceſſities (i. e.</hi> indifferencies circumſtantial) muſt arrive at Conſcience with their <hi>Expediencies,</hi> which muſt be the ballance of Election in things equally good in themſelves; their <hi>comparative</hi> goodneſs, muſt be <hi>reſpective,</hi> or evil muſt make ſome appearance to the <hi>judgement of diſcretion;</hi> and a Chriſtians <hi>freedom</hi> in the exerciſe of the ſaid judgement according to the ſeveral caſes he meets withal, is his <hi>Liberty,</hi> which Chriſt hath purchaſed, and a Chriſtian cannot be deprived of <hi>jure</hi> by any <hi>Exotick Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 10. Where things are abſolutely indifferent, and there is no apparent reſpective difference between <hi>adiaphorous things,</hi> it's a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135610:33"/>Chriſtians <hi>liberty</hi> to take the one or the other, he ſins not againſt any rules of <hi>Expedience</hi> in taking either; for both are lawful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient enough: neither do I know why any additional Law ſhould make him a Tranſgreſſor in <hi>chuſing</hi> or <hi>refuſing</hi> of either in matters of Religion; for an action or thing may be equally lawful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient <hi>morally,</hi> which for ſome other reaſons may not, ariſing from Nature, his own inclinations, or ſome other ſmall attending <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> of which it may not be fit to give an account to any humane Authority as the Tranſgreſſor of any Law.</p>
            <p>§ 11. As <hi>particular perſons</hi> by the rules of Expediency may judge of things indifferent to prefer one before another according to their reſpect, to know precepts, or to chuſe one before another <hi>arbitrarily,</hi> where there is no difference in compared reſpects: So particular <hi>Churches</hi> and Congregations have the liberty of uſing their <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcretion</hi> in matters of indifferency, and are to walk by rules of Expediency, for Time, Place, and external Accommodations, but cannot make any binding Law to themſelves or others; becauſe thoſe things are alterable in their circumſtances, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be determined but <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and muſt be liable ſtill to no other judgement than that of <hi>Diſcretion:</hi> Thoſe things that Chriſt hath left under it, cannot by humane Laws be removed from it; therefore indifferent things may be agreed on by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Congregations, or by the Officers thereof, according as the <hi>expediency or conveniency</hi> appears unto them, and for ſo long, and no longer. Hence they cannot undergo the Title or Denomination of a Law, but onely of <hi>prudential Rules,</hi> which have no binding rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for obſervation, but the continuance of the <hi>agreeing circumſtances;</hi> as it may be judged moſt <hi>convenient</hi> by the Church to aſſemble at ſuch an hour, ſo long as the days are of ſuch a length; but when that circumſtance alters, then it may be more convenient at another. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch inſtances may be given, and no Church can walk comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably as long as any Authority undertakes to prohibit them of this liberty of their <hi>Prudentials</hi> in all ſuch matters of circumſtance and alterable appendixes to the worſhip of God.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Wherein is handled the firſt Queſtion about things Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. THe firſt Queſtion that ſeems to offer itſelf to be ſo, this: <hi>Whether a religious Goſpel-Indifferency ceaſeth to be ſo, when any thing is poſitively and certainly determined as to its practice by humane Authority? Explic.</hi> By religious <hi>Goſpel-Indifferency,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, as before-mentioned, any thing or action which <hi>circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> adheres to the worſhip of God, and may be uſed or omitted, or altered, according to the judgement of <hi>diſcretion,</hi> without any tranſgreſſion of <hi>a Law</hi> of Chriſt. Again, this we acknowledge, that a thing may be determined as to <hi>Expediency</hi> by a Society or lawful Authority, but not impoſed as a ſtanding and binding Law; but being commended by the judgements of many concurring, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly ſtudious</hi> of the minde and will of Chriſt, it carries the more force along with it, to perſwade us at leaſt to preſent acting, till by further and greater <hi>illumination</hi> we be otherwiſe enclined. Nay if any thing be determined by thoſe that are in Authority, and propoſed as their judgement according to their light received, not <hi>Magiſterially,</hi> but <hi>Demonſtratively</hi> onely, <hi>convincingly</hi> enough as to the <hi>Expediency,</hi> it carries with it the force of a Law unto Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (not of man, but of God, man being a Candleſtick onely to hold forth that Light) and binds it to ſubmit thereunto. But otherwiſe, if men in authority undertake to make a Law that a thing (in itſelf by Chriſt's Law left <hi>indifferent,</hi> i. e. to Chriſtian diſcretion to do or omit) ſhall become an abſolute <hi>neceſſity,</hi> or an expedient <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and according to their will and opinion binde Inferiours to the conſtant practice of this by a penalty: We affirm that a religious <hi>Goſpel-Indifferency</hi> (notwithſtanding all humane authoritative determination changing it into a neceſſity) keeps its priſtine indifferency, and remains the ſame to a Chriſtians Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and practice. The proof of this Aſſertion follows.</p>
            <p>§ 2. <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. That power that can change <hi>Goſpel-indifferencies</hi> into <hi>Goſpel-neceſſities,</hi> can alſo change <hi>Goſpel-neceſſities</hi> into <hi>Goſpel-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencies;</hi> but no humane Authority can do the latter, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:135610:34"/>the former. The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> will not be denied by any Proteſtant, it being a preſumption of the higheſt nature for humane authority to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to diſpenſe with or null any of the manifeſt Laws of Chriſt. The <hi>Major</hi> is alſo evident, becauſe it muſt be an Authority of the ſame kind to <hi>make</hi> and <hi>null</hi> a Law of the ſame kinde. If it be ſaid a humane authority may make a <hi>Goſpel-indifferency neceſſary, genere civili,</hi> the Anſwer falls far ſhort; for we ſpeak of Laws of the ſame kinde, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving equal force upon the Conſcience: for a <hi>Civil Legiſlative power</hi> can as well null any Law of a <hi>civil nature</hi> onely, as it can make it. So if Man could make Moral Laws, he might as well null thoſe which he hath made, or diſpenſe with them at pleaſure, as make new. We muſt always allow a <hi>Soveraign Prerogative</hi> to Supream Law-givers in any kinde, as to <hi>promulgate,</hi> ſo to <hi>abrogate</hi> or <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with their own Laws at pleaſure: And if it be ſaid that thoſe Laws that man makes concerning the uſe of indifferent things neceſſarily in the worſhip of Chriſt, are <hi>civil</hi> onely, being onely for <hi>decency, ſplendor,</hi> &amp;c. I reply, that it cannot be ſo in the nature of them; for it's the reſpect and end of a thing that gives it its <hi>ſpecifical deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> when it hath none ſuch abſolutely conſidered: that which reſpects and aims at the <hi>Goſpel-worſhip</hi> of Chriſt, or pretends ſo to do, is or ſhould be a part of <hi>Goſpel-worſhip;</hi> as <hi>kneeling</hi> is an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent geſture; a man may kneel when he doth other things beſides acts of Worſhip; or according to the Law of Chriſt, he may kneel, or ſtand, or uſe another poſture in Worſhip: but when this or that geſture is applied to Worſhip, it's religious by its <hi>Reſpect, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> and <hi>Application,</hi> but ſtill of an indifferent nature under the Laws of Chriſt, till by ſome binding Law the Conſcience becomes <hi>bound</hi> up to the uſe of it in this or that part of <hi>Worſhip.</hi> Now he that undertakes to binde Conſcience here, undertakes to make a Law for Chriſt, and to entrench upon the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of Chriſt; and that ſuch that make ſuch Laws do claim ſuch a power, is manifeſt, becauſe they make obedience unto ſuch Laws neceſſary by vertue of a Law of Chriſt: <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If the nature of an <hi>Evangelical Indifferency</hi> may be changed <hi>jure</hi> into an <hi>Evangelical Neceſſity,</hi> by any power beſides Chriſt's, then it muſt be becauſe it's <hi>Evangelically evil,</hi> that this or that ſhould remain <hi>indifferent</hi> which Chriſt hath left ſo, or at leaſt better for the honour of Chriſt and good of his Church, that it ſhould become a <hi>neceſſity (i. e.</hi> a commanded good, or prohibited evil) than <hi>indifferent,</hi> to be diſpoſed by the diſcretion of particular
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135610:35"/>Churches or Chriſtians; but there is no true <hi>Evangelical Indifferency</hi> that hath ſuch a reaſon for the change of it into a <hi>neceſſity; Ergo,</hi> the reaſon of the Conſequence is this, becauſe whatever is altered by a Law, is ſuppoſed to be altered from <hi>worſe to better;</hi> and what is altered by a Law for Chriſt, is or ſhould be made more for the honour of Chriſt, and therefore far better than it was before; but it cannot be ſuppoſed that any thing that this wiſe Law-giver left in indifferency to practice or omit according to the judgement of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, ſhould be more for his honour if it were converted into a neceſſity by a Law; for to ſay ſo, would be a high <hi>impeachment</hi> of the wiſdom of Chriſt, as it is of a King and Parliament, when any ſhall preſume to ſay they have not made ſuch Laws as are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be made, and have left the Subject under a greater liberty than is for the good of the Commonweal, or honour of the King. To ſay ſo therefore is to make a double reflexion on Chriſt: Firſt, that his Laws are <hi>defective,</hi> for the accompliſhment of thoſe ends for which they were eſtabliſhed, and that the liberty granted by Chriſt unto his Members in indifferent things, hath too great a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to be conſiſtent with that exact Goſpel-worſhip which we ſhould honour him by. And if it be ſaid, that which Chriſt hath left <hi>Evangelically indifferent</hi> may be unlawful in reſpect of other Laws, we ſay that all the true <hi>jus</hi> of other Laws muſt be founded on Chriſt's; and his is <hi>precedaneous</hi> to them, and therefore as in authority or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it muſt take place before them. Moreover, we ſay, that Chriſt hath not ſo ill eſtabliſh'd <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> as that thereby we are licenſed to violate any natural or civil bonds.</p>
            <p>§ 4. <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. That which by Chriſt's Authority hath left a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> impreſſed on Conſcience, cannot by any authority be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without removal of the ſaid <hi>Character;</hi> but as the Laws, ſo the Liberty by <hi>Goſpel-Charter</hi> granted by Chriſt, hath left ſuch a Character impreſſed indelibly on Conſcience, as cannot be removed by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authority, therefore Chriſtian Liberty cannot be abrogated, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> a religious Goſpel-indifferency cannot be taken away or ceaſe by the determination of mere humane Laws, <hi>i. e.</hi> humane Laws that Chriſt never allowed man to make.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is evident, in that the revealed will of Chriſt when it ſhines into the Heart, fixeth an indelible <hi>Character</hi> upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for poſitive obedience, and alſo as to indifferent things; for he that knows not one by the Law, knows not the other, nor can never tell when he ſins and when he doth not; and if any other
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135610:35"/>could interpoſe and make a Law to binde Conſcience <hi>ſub reatu</hi> by <hi>new Laws,</hi> or releaſe it by <hi>new Liberties,</hi> either to make additional Characters, or <hi>delete</hi> Chriſt's, Chriſtian Religion would thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no other than an undigeſted heap of <hi>uncertainties</hi> and <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> It's true, <hi>Characters</hi> are ſometimes removed from Conſcience, as in caſe of <hi>Juſtification</hi> of a ſinner by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. So in caſe of an <hi>erring Conſcience</hi> (that ſuppoſeth this to be his duty which is not, and that to be indifferent which is neceſſary) all errour when entertained lays hold on Conſcience, <hi>Sub pretextu authoritatis Chriſti,</hi> under pretence of <hi>Chriſt's Authority,</hi> and ſo do all humane uſurping Laws when they inſinuate themſelves into Conſcience; and when by a farther informing light the Errour is expell'd from the <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> the Authority of Chriſt ſtill remains expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Errour,</hi> which no humane Authority could do, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Conſcience in the truth, maugre all the oppoſition of any humane power: ſo that where Chriſt's Laws hath once prevailed ſo far as to <hi>fix</hi> his Authority there, it was never known (that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mens external practices or conformities were) that ever any humane Power could <hi>blot</hi> out the Characters of Chriſt's <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and fix another Supremacy there; for that is but a vain Law in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious things, that cannot binde the Conſcience under <hi>guilt</hi> in caſe of tranſgreſſion: I ſhall never conſcienciouſly obſerve that for my <hi>duty,</hi> the omiſſion of which doth not make me conſcious of a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. As to the <hi>Minor,</hi> that the <hi>liberty</hi> granted by Chriſt leaves a Character on Conſcience as well as the Laws of Chriſt, is manifeſt, 1. Becauſe Laws are the bounds of Liberty, and one muſt be known and acted as well as the other, as hath been ſaid before. 2. Becauſe their liberty is not the will of Chriſt <hi>permiſſive</hi> onely, but in ſome meaſure <hi>poſitive,</hi> i. e. ſo far as that Chriſtians ſhould walk in it, he having but two paths to walk in, either of <hi>poſitively directed obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> or of <hi>Liberty</hi> under the judgement of <hi>diſcretion</hi> regulated by the rules of Expediency; for either in matters of inſtituted Worſhip Chriſt hath by a manifeſtation of his will, limited our Actions, or hath left Churches and Chriſtians in the <hi>Equilibrio</hi> of indifferency to poiſe themſelves according to Conſcience-Light, as to reſpective differencies by diſcretion, and where there is an equality to chuſe <hi>pro arbitrio:</hi> Again, our <hi>aſſurance</hi> is not onely <hi>negative,</hi> but <hi>poſitive,</hi> that it is Chriſt's will that we ſhould maintain our liberty in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious things, <hi>ſtand faſt in that liberty,</hi> &amp;c. Neither can any take it away without intruding on Conſcience, and entrenching on his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:135610:36"/>which for us to yield to were to betray his <hi>Crown and Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 5. <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Hence if ſuch a Law be made, it ought not to be made, and <hi>ergo</hi> the thing retains its priſtine nature. That Law which directly puts a Chriſtian on a <hi>neceſſity of ſinning</hi> in obeying it, ought not to be made; but a Law that changeth <hi>Evangelical indifferencies</hi> into <hi>neceſſities,</hi> doth directly put a Chriſtian on a neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning if he obeys; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it ought not to be made. That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor may be univerſal, I adde, (directly) becauſe many good Laws are occaſions of ſinning indirectly; but when the Law requires ſuch obedience which in the very ſubſtance of it is ſin, becauſe the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience directly aimed at is the <hi>formal reaſon of the Law,</hi> ſuch a Law muſt needs be ſinful. The Minor doth thus appear; becauſe ſuch a Law bindes a man up in obedience to it in one part of the <hi>indifferency,</hi> whereas that part of the indifferency, according to Chriſt's rules of expediency, may be unlawful to be done, and then the humane Law and the ſaid Goſpel-rules contradict one another, <hi>Expediencies</hi> altering daily as to attending circumſtances; at ſome times it's lawful to do that thing which at another is more agreeable to the honour of Chriſt, and the good of others to avoid. As for Example: the Apoſtle reckons eating this or that ſort of meat ſold in the Shambles as an indifferent thing, if I make no queſtion whether it be <hi>Jewiſhly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> or <hi>Heatheniſhly ſacrificed</hi> to Idols, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25, 27. but if I am enforced by Law to eat this or that ſort of meat in the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which is <hi>ſacrificed</hi> to Idols, I am neceſſitated to ſin, 1. I offend my Brother that makes this Law, confirming him in ſin, for the ſake of whoſe Conſcience I ought by the Apoſtles rule to forbear this act, and therefore ſin againſt all ſuch as idolatrouſly eat this ſacrificed meat: For what can tell me more plainly than the Law, that this or that meat by its attending circumſtances is <hi>ſacrificed</hi> to Idols? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to hear the Word of God in this or that <hi>publick place,</hi> is an <hi>indifferency;</hi> to hear it to my <hi>edification</hi> as near as poſſible, is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt: but if I am bound by a humane Law to hear always in my own Pariſh-church, and thereby debarred of my liberty of hearing there where I can moſt profit; and whereas the Pariſh-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is <hi>ignorant, prophane,</hi> or <hi>erroneous,</hi> whom to hear conſtantly muſt needs be ſin to me, I am certainly by this Law put upon a neceſſity of ſinning in yielding active obedience unto it.</p>
            <p>§ 6. <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. That <hi>Indifferencies of a Goſpel-nature</hi> cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd from their nature by any ſubſequent Law of man, thus appears.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:135610:36"/>To change religious Indifferencies into Neceſſities, is to make a Law for Chriſts Worſhip that Chriſt never made, nor gave any man pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make; but none may make a Law for the Worſhip of Chriſt which he never made, nor impowred any to make; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor is without doubt: if the indifferency confeſſed be in the worſhip of God, then when it's by any Law made neceſſary, it's ſtill in the worſhip of God, and being appointed ſo by a Law, becomes <hi>inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Worſhip:</hi> by a Law which Chriſt never made. The Minor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that none may do ſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> inſtitute Worſhip or circumſtances of Worſhip by a <hi>Law</hi> that is not Chriſt's. 1. It's his <hi>Prerogative</hi> to exerciſe a Legiſlative power in his Church. 2. Chriſt knows onely how he will be worſhipped, and it muſt be founded on his revealed will, which is our Law. 3. None might adde to his Laws un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.1, 2. much leſs under the New, where there is leſs of Ceremony and Circumſtances, <hi>Rev.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>§ 1. WHen we come to diſcuſs the power of the Church, it's very requiſite to unfold the meaning of the word <hi>Church,</hi> there being no word under which lieth more Amphibology. Many underſtand a Church a material <hi>building,</hi> or place of <hi>meeting</hi> for the worſhip of God, being <hi>conſecrated</hi> and ſet apart for that uſe: and for the <hi>Propriety and Antiquity</hi> of this uſage and acceptation of <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> learned Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> very much contends. We ſhall not ſtay upon this ſence, becauſe none that will oppoſe us in the preſent controverſie will inſiſt upon this ſence ſo far as to ſay that the Legiſlative Power is to be found here.</p>
            <p>A Church is alſo in other ſences ſpoken of: Some ſay, <hi>every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> where Chriſtian Religion is owned by ruling Authority, and by the generality of the people profeſſed, is a Church. Some call a <hi>Province</hi> a Church, a <hi>Dioceſs</hi> a Church, a <hi>Pariſh</hi> a Church; ſo that it's more or leſs extended, and comprehenſive; and it's uſually the ſence of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that aſſert a <hi>Churches</hi> Legiſlative Authority in matters indifferent. Others ſay there is no <hi>national Churches</hi> under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, though there be Churches in every Nation; and that properly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135610:37"/>there are no particular Churches, but ſuch who freely and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>combine</hi> together in bonds of Society for the worſhipping of God according to his revealed will, and walk accordingly. Various are the <hi>Sentiments</hi> and Diſputes about a Church and the nature of it, the conſideration of which will not be ſo much our concern at this time.</p>
            <p>But there is another way of the uſage of <hi>Church,</hi> wherein there is greater <hi>ambiguity,</hi> which is very much to the matter in hand that we rightly underſtand it, <hi>viz,</hi> the <hi>emphatical uſe</hi> of the word, <hi>The Church;</hi> ſo many mens Writings and Argumentations being filled and confounded with it now a days, that who can tell what they mean by <hi>The Church?</hi> The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſay, the Church hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined this or that; and when we enquire what that Church is, they ſay the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which being rightly underſtood, is the true meaning of <hi>the Church</hi> according to that rule, <hi>Aequivocum per ſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum, ſtat pro famoſiori ſignificato,</hi> the Emphaſis putting the word up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the higheſt and largeſt <hi>ſignification;</hi> but when we come to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſquiſion of their meaning, they tell us, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Church, and all others that diſſent or ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not the Church, or of the true <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Proteſtants alſo that ſpeak of the Church, do not underſtand the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but ſome particular <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church,</hi> viz. of <hi>France, England, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. but when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what this Church is, they will tell us, it's the body of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> met together in a Convocation by a few Repreſentatives, to make <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions;</hi> the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power whereof is in the Biſhops and their Courts; ſo that when theſe few men have made Laws, or exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, compoſe Forms of Prayer, or eſtabliſh Ceremonies at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they ſay the <hi>Church</hi> did it. Theſe two ſorts of men make uſe of this great commanding Word the <hi>Church:</hi> and by this <hi>equivocal term,</hi> ſounding ſo loud of an uncontroulable Prerogative, they ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt unto poor well-meaning people on the one ſide, that all that the <hi>Pope and the Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth; on the other hand, that all that the <hi>Biſhops and their Courts</hi> do, is done by the Church, as if it were the whole <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal viſible Church.</hi> It is not my preſent task here to enquire what is the true meaning of the Church according to the <hi>Scripture-acceptation,</hi> or the moſt true Logical notion thereof, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a <hi>Genus,</hi> or an <hi>Integrum,</hi> or <hi>totum Aggregativum.</hi> I ſhall onely in the enſuing Diſcourſe apply my ſelf to the moſt rectified ſence of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135610:37"/>thoſe that do defend the <hi>Legiſlative Authority of the Church,</hi> and if they will not ſtart from all right Reaſon, and Rules of <hi>Logick,</hi> their ſence muſt be, That <hi>the Catholick Militant Church</hi> is <hi>The Church,</hi> (whether it may be Organical according to Scripture-conſtitution, we argue not now) conſtituted of <hi>Subordinate parts,</hi> firſt <hi>National,</hi> (or if you pleaſe Patriarchal before that of National) made up of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, Provincial of Dioceſan, Dioceſan of Parochial: and this ought to be the ſincere meaning of The Church, without prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the ſence of thoſe beforementioned.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Now the main thing in Debate between the Aſſertors of the Churches Authority, and the Diſſentors from it, is, Whether the <hi>Church</hi> may exerciſe ſuch a Power, as may <hi>change Indifferencies in the Worſhip of God, into Neceſſities?</hi> Which we hold in the <hi>Negative,</hi> and ſay, That Chriſt hath never granted ſuch Power unto the Church; he hath granted an <hi>Executive Power</hi> unto his Church, but never a <hi>Legiſlative Power;</hi> for all lawful power that any Church hath, it muſt have it from the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who hath all power given unto him in Heaven and Earth, and is the peculiar King of his Church, and hath taken care for the right <hi>Ordering</hi> and <hi>Governance</hi> of it in all things neceſſary as to Salvation, ſo to Order and Diſcipline. And therefore what is not derived from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be allowed to be lawfully exerciſed. 'Tis true, if it could be ſhewed where Chriſt ever granted it by his Charter to his Church, that in ſome particular concerns ſhe might exert a Legiſlative Power, the diſpute would ſoon be ended; but no ſuch Charter could ever be ſhewn.</p>
            <p>§ 3. If any ſuch Power be granted by Chriſt, it muſt be granted to the <hi>Catholick Church Militant,</hi> or to <hi>particular ſubordinate Churches;</hi> but 'tis not granted to either of them, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Not to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> becauſe it is not <hi>organized</hi> with Officers capable of a <hi>Catholick Rule;</hi> unleſs we will (upon falſe ſuppoſition) allow the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or ſomething like it: As for <hi>Oecumenical Councils,</hi> we ſee what inſuperable difficulties have attended the calling of them in all Ages, the juſt grounds of Exceptions in many things, of the Determination of doubtful caſes in Doctrine, and in almoſt all they have done in their pretences to a Law-making Power, in matters of Church-Order and Diſcipline. We have not any ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt hath entruſted any Officers of his Church with a <hi>Catholick Power</hi> ſince the Apoſtes days; and ſuch as have pretended to it, have always bin oppoſed by the pureſt and moſt reformed part
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:135610:38"/>of the Church: and whatever mens attempts be, or may be, they will never finde a <hi>Catholick Eccleſiaſtcal</hi> Power here on Earth (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a new manifeſtation of the Son of Man) which can exerciſe ſuch a power of changing <hi>Indifferencies into Neceſſities</hi> by a Law, wherein the Minds and Conſciences of particular Churches and Chriſtians will or may reſt ſatisfied, to ſubmit unto, in <hi>active Obedience.</hi> It's as irrational to affirm, that Chriſt hath committed ſuch a power to <hi>particular Churches, i. e.</hi> of making binding Laws <hi>Sub poenâ</hi> for other Churches, or for their own Members, or Churches ſubordinate to them: not for other <hi>coordinate Churches,</hi> will they ſay, Chriſt never <hi>gave coordinate Churehes a coercive Power</hi> one over another, for then all would aſpire to <hi>Rule,</hi> and none be Ruled, for the power would belong to one as well as another. And if any ſay (as the Papiſts do) that Chriſt hath advanced one Church in Dignity and Juriſdiction over all the reſt, let them prove it to the conviction of any intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Chriſtian, and they will do more than the Papiſts have done, ever ſince their pretence thereunto. But it will be pleaded by the Proteſtant party, that Chriſt hath entruſted every <hi>particular Church</hi> with this power, whereby it may determine of indifferent things of her own practice. To which we anſwer, 1. That Chriſt hath given no Legiſlative Power to any Church. 2. A Judgment of Diſcretion to walk by the Rules of Expediency, is no more to be denied to particular Churches, than to particular Chriſtians. But for all this Judgment of Diſcretion, Indifferencies looſe not their nature, (though they may be neceſſary <hi>pro hic</hi> or <hi>nunc,</hi> in theſe or thoſe circumſtances) and are and muſt ſtand capable of dayly Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the caſe ſhall require; and a particular Church may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of this or that part of the Indifferency, as moſt expedient; and ſo long as the <hi>Reaſons</hi> thereof laſt, it may be in ſome meaſure bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto particular mens conſciences; but the <hi>Reaſons ceaſing,</hi> the continuance of the Canon in force <hi>in foro Eccleſiae,</hi> will binde no mans Conſcience; yea, every one will complain of it as a needleſs Impoſition: neither will any noble-minded Chriſtian be a Servant to the Wills and Humours of Man, or ſell the Birth-right (the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed) for <hi>Pins and Points;</hi> neither is it a ſufficient Rule for Diſcretion to walk by, becauſe the Church commands, and gives no Reaſon from the Law of Chriſt for it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, What Church hath this power committed to them? a Pariſh, a Dioceſs, a Province? No, 'twill not be granted of either of them. The great Aſſertors of this Power will ſay, That it belongs to every
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:135610:38"/>National Church to make Laws in <hi>matters of Indifferency,</hi> and ſo ordain their own <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> This is an Aſſertion that introduceth a <hi>whole herd of Abſurdities</hi> with it; For firſt, What is the great end pretended of ſuch Laws, but the making of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in the <hi>Church?</hi> What is more deſtructive to it than this, that every <hi>particular Church</hi> ſhould be <hi>Independent,</hi> and make Laws within themſelves? whereas one will ordain Ceremonies of one kinde, and another of another, and there will be as many <hi>ſorts of Ceremonies</hi> as there are <hi>particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> Is not this the great exception againſt the <hi>Diſſenters from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Churches,</hi> that the particular Paſtors of each Congregation ſet up for themſelves, and <hi>Exerciſe Juriſdiction</hi> within themſelves, without dependence upon any <hi>Superiour Power?</hi> There is no avoiding it upon this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> but National Churches muſt be reckon'd <hi>Independent Churches.</hi> 2. Did Chriſt commit any ſuch power to any ſuch Churches on Earth? 3. Again, If National Churches may exert ſuch a power, then they may make binding Laws to all <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Churches,</hi> viz. <hi>Provincial, Dioceſan, Parochial;</hi> and if ſo, then for this Reaſon, becauſe they are more <hi>comprehenſive Churches,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the leſs: Then by the ſame Reaſon, the moſt <hi>comprehenſive Church,</hi> viz. <hi>the Catholick,</hi> ſhould give Laws to the <hi>National,</hi> and for a greater and more eminent end, <hi>viz.</hi> to promote an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick;</hi> for if a <hi>National <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> be ſo ſplendid, and ſo much conducing to the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of the Church, then a <hi>Catholick</hi> much more.</p>
            <p>§ 4. <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. To make a <hi>Law</hi> contrary to the revealed Will of Chriſt, is <hi>unlawful and Sinful;</hi> But for the Church by a Law to change <hi>Indifferencies</hi> into <hi>Neceſſities,</hi> is to make a Law contrary to the <hi>revealed Will</hi> of Chriſt; <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is granted: for theſe <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,</hi> ſay they, do not by their Laws eſtabliſh any thing contrary to <hi>the revealed Will</hi> of Chriſt; for hath he any where forbidden <hi>ſuch Ceremonies?</hi> We proceed therefore to the proof of the <hi>Minor.</hi> If all <hi>Neceſſities</hi> in the Worſhip of Chriſt be made ſo by Chriſt's Will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and all <hi>Indifferencies</hi> become ſuch, becauſe they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained under Chriſt's Law; then they are ſo, becauſe Chriſt would have them to be ſo: For a Chriſtian can take no meaſure of <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencies,</hi> but by the Law of Chriſt; for he cannot know them but by knowing the Law binding unto <hi>Neceſſities</hi> by <hi>Commands</hi> or <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions.</hi> So that <hi>Indifferencies</hi> are made ſo by the revealed Will of Chriſt, as well as <hi>Neceſſities;</hi> and the ſame Law that makes the one thing a <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> makes another an <hi>Indifferency;</hi> and Chriſt in his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:135610:39"/>Wiſdome ſees it beſt for his Goſpel-church, that it ſhould be ſo: and he that undertakes to make theſe <hi>indifferent things neceſſary,</hi> enters upon a high preſumption, no leſs than the altering the <hi>moral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of a thing, conſtituted by the revealed Will of Chriſt; and what is this leſs than making Laws contrary to the ſaid Will of Chriſt? That is only neceſſary in the Worſhip of Chriſt, which he hath made ſo, and that indifferent which he hath left ſo by his Will; an <hi>Indifference</hi> in his Worſhip is no other than ſomething <hi>not neceſſary</hi> in his Worſhip, for there is no <hi>medium,</hi> they are <hi>adverſa.</hi> Therefore he that wills ſomething to be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> which Chriſt willed <hi>not neceſſary,</hi> doth will ſomething <hi>contrary to the Will of Chriſt,</hi> by all Rules of <hi>Logick</hi> and right Reaſon in the world. I know it will be anſwered, That they do not alter the nature of the thing, it remains as it was; but this or that determination for practice is to be <hi>obeyed</hi> when it is <hi>commanded;</hi> as the Father commands a Child to take up a Pin, it's an indifferent thing to take it up or let it alone; but becauſe of the Fathers command he is <hi>bound</hi> to do it. Anſ. It's true, becauſe there is a command of Chriſt, that enjoyns the <hi>Child's Obedience in all lawful things,</hi> and therefore upon the Fathers command it becomes <hi>neceſſary</hi> that the child yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but this is but a command for one particular action, and therefore under Expediency: If the Father ſhould make a Law, that one child ſhould pick ſtraws all his days, and another play at puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, ſuch Laws would become null in the nature of them: but there is nothing more abſurd, than to affirm that they alter not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing; for what can alter it more, than to lay it <hi>under a Law?</hi> when a thing was <hi>indifferent</hi> unto practice before, to make it <hi>neceſſary</hi> as to practice; when it was <hi>lawful</hi> before, to make it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi> We have ſhewed that Neceſſities and Indifferencies are but relative in reſpect of the Law; and he makes a Law, that gives things contrary relations and reſpects to what they had before, alters the nature of the thing as much as a Law can, and makes one Law contrary to another. Men do but trifle, that plead that things are not made <hi>neceſſary in the Worſhip of God,</hi> when the practice of them are enjoyn'd under the greateſt <hi>Church-penalties,</hi> (what's greater than Excommunication?) yea, pecuniary Mulcts, Impriſonments, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, and Offenders againſt the Laws perſecuted with greater rigour, than thoſe who live in the conſtant and open Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of <hi>Moral and Goſpel-Precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 5. I may take another very plain <hi>medium</hi> to prove the <hi>Minor;</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:135610:39"/>thus: He that makes a thing <hi>unlawful,</hi> either to be done or left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, which Chriſt hath made <hi>lawful</hi> by his Law, doth that which is contrary to the Word of God; but he that changes <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies</hi> into <hi>Neceſſities</hi> doth ſo. There is nothing more plain than the Major: for to make a thing unlawful, <hi>&amp;c. Lawful</hi> and <hi>unlawful</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>contradicentia,</hi> and he that by a new Law renders that <hi>unlawful</hi> for my practice, which Chriſt's Law hath rendred <hi>lawful,</hi> doth a thing <hi>e Regione,</hi> contrary to the Law of Chriſt: For the Minor, its as evident, for by the Law of Chriſt, the indifferent action was lawful for me to do or omit, as to eat ſuch a ſort of <hi>Meat,</hi> or keep <hi>ſuch a day,</hi> or <hi>wear ſuch a garment;</hi> but there is a new Law of the Church comes, which now makes it <hi>unlawful</hi> for me, either to do or not to do thoſe things; for he that makes a Law binding always to the practice of either part of the <hi>indifferency,</hi> makes the other part <hi>unlawful,</hi> which antecedaneous to this Law was lawful. Now the Church of Chriſt cannot make that <hi>unlawful,</hi> which he hath made <hi>lawful;</hi> for they may as well make that <hi>lawful to do or omit.</hi> Again, If the Church may make that <hi>unlawful</hi> which he hath made <hi>lawful,</hi> then ſhe may take away the <hi>Relative Goodneſs</hi> that is in any part of an <hi>indifferent action,</hi> by the Rules of Expediency, and ſtamp upon it a <hi>poſitive evil;</hi> which is contrary to what Chriſt hath done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, Nothing can be <hi>Eccleſiaſtically</hi> and therefore <hi>Religiouſly unlawful,</hi> which is not made <hi>Eccleſiaſtically and Religiouſly Evil;</hi> and nothing can be ſo <hi>Jure,</hi> but by the Will of Chriſt, no more than any thing can be <hi>Eccleſiaſtically good and neceſſary</hi> without the ſaid revealed Will of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>§ 6. <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. The <hi>Church</hi> is not capable of a <hi>Law-making Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi> Ergo. I prove it thus; He that cannot <hi>jure</hi> or <hi>de facto</hi> annex a Puniſhment in ſome meaſure <hi>correſpondent</hi> to the nature of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that will be committed againſt that Law, cannot make ſuch a Law; as if a Corporation under the King makes a Law to hang or burn in the hand for ſome Offence, which they have no power to do, then that is null. The <hi>Major</hi> is very plain. But the Church cannot <hi>de facto,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>de jure,</hi> Execute ſuch penalties as are <hi>correſpondent</hi> to her Laws; for they being <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> are of a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> nature, belonging to the Worſhip of God: and therefore the Lawmaker will ſtill have the firſt ſtroak of his Law <hi>fall upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> by binding it under <hi>guilt:</hi> where was ever any truely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Conſcience ever bound under <hi>guilt</hi> for tranſgreſſing a <hi>mere Church-Law</hi> in matters of Ceremony? <hi>Secondly,</hi> They cannot <hi>de
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:135610:40"/>Jure</hi> annex and execute the <hi>Penalties</hi> of Excluſion from communion; as Chriſt never made a mere <hi>Ceremony</hi> the condition of communion, ſo he never threatned the Non-obſervation with <hi>Non-communion:</hi> Let any Precept or any Inſtance be given of this nature, that any ſuffer'd Church-cenſures under the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> for Non-obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Ceremonial Law. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for other Penalties, which we call <hi>Secular,</hi> as Whipping, Impriſoning, Fining, Confiſcating, we know the Church hath nothing to do with them; they were never in the power of the Church, nor never will be.</p>
            <p>§ 7. <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. That Law which <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>unavoidably</hi> hinders much good, and cauſeth much evil in the <hi>obediential Subjection</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ought not to be made by the Church; but to change religious Indifferencies in the worſhip of God, into Neceſſities, doth ſo: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable; for though a good action may <hi>per accidens</hi> hinder ſome <hi>other good,</hi> and cauſe ſome <hi>evil,</hi> yet it doth not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and in its true conſtituted nature; but <hi>good</hi> actions produce <hi>good</hi> effects, as <hi>evil</hi> actions <hi>evil.</hi> So the Tree is known by its Fruits. The <hi>Minor,</hi> that ſuch a change works ſuch ill effects is thus proved. 1. Becauſe it hinders the moſt <hi>expedient uſe</hi> of an action left by Chriſt <hi>indifferent,</hi> to be determined by the Judgement of <hi>Diſcretion;</hi> whereas the <hi>Expediency</hi> by Chriſt's preſcript, may lye in the contrary part of the action wherein a goodneſs is placed by the <hi>Churches</hi> Law, and an evil placed in that part of the action wherein there is a goodneſs by <hi>Chriſt's.</hi> So that the Churches Law cannot have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Obedience yielded to it without ſin, becauſe when Chriſt's expediency falleth on the part contrary to the Law, it will be ſin to obey the Church; <hi>As for Example,</hi> It's an indifferent thing which way we turn our Faces in the worſhip of God, Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South; the Church makes a Law the Miniſter muſt turn his Face toward the Eaſt, in ſuch a part of Worſhip, this hinders the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient uſe of that <hi>poſture.</hi> 1. It hinders from turning that way which is moſt for <hi>Edification,</hi> and cauſeth the Miniſter to turn his back to the people, which is very <hi>unexpedient.</hi> It may confirm a <hi>Jew, Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Papiſt</hi> in their Superſtitious Obſervances, to obſerve us to do thus <hi>de induſtriâ,</hi> out of a ſtrict obſervation, and therefore then <hi>unexpedient.</hi> 2. It <hi>hinders much Good,</hi> becauſe it fruſtrates <hi>Chriſts</hi> Ends in the management of Religious and Eccleſiaſtical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> manageth all thoſe by <hi>Neceſſities</hi> and <hi>Indifferencies,</hi> in willing and requiring a neceſſary Obedience to his poſitive Laws, and <hi>an indifferent uſe of indifferent things,</hi> according to the Rules of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:135610:40"/>
               <hi>Expediency and Judgment of Diſcretion:</hi> And this proceeding in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual affairs, is that which is moſt conducing to the <hi>Glory</hi> of his Name, and the <hi>Beauty</hi> of his Church. How great a <hi>preſumption</hi> is it in any Church to attempt the altering this courſe of Government, which Chriſt the Head hath <hi>ſettled,</hi> and fruſtrate his ends in Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Indifferencies, by cauſing thoſe things which he hath made <hi>neceſſary</hi> to become <hi>indifferencies,</hi> and what he hath made <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> to be done <hi>neceſſarily;</hi> and hindring that conſcientious, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet, occaſional uſe, which he hath determined and required, as moſt <hi>conducing</hi> to his own Glory, and the good of his Body the Church?</p>
            <p>§ 8. Now whereas the <hi>End of exerciſing this Juridical Power</hi> (ſo much pleaded for in the late <hi>Centuries</hi> of the Church) is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity;</hi> without doubt, this <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>primarily</hi> belongs to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> that the whole <hi>viſible Body</hi> of Chriſt may be one and the ſame in Diſcipline and Ceremonies. For if it be ſo deſirous, and to be maintain'd with ſuch a great curioſity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs of Ceremony in <hi>a particular Church,</hi> how much rather ought it to be in the <hi>Catholick; a Catholick Good</hi> being much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, and of far greater concernment than a <hi>particular Good?</hi> But as we have ſhewed, that there is no ſuch <hi>Catholick Power</hi> in the <hi>Catholick viſible</hi> Church practicable, ſo it's eaſie to make manifeſt, that <hi>a Catholick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in matters of Indifferency, will never be attained among <hi>Churches,</hi> or particular Chriſtians; nor never was intended by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, any more than that all his Members ſhould wear the <hi>ſame Cloaths,</hi> or dwell in the ſame ſhaped Houſes; for had it been neceſſary that there ſhould have been no <hi>difference in indifferent things,</hi> but all ſhould have gone the ſame way in the uſe of them, and none varied according to the judgment of Diſcretion: then Chriſt would have made it <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all thoſe things would have been Neceſſities, and there would have been no Indifferencies at all; but we ſee that Chriſt deſigned it for the <hi>Benefit and Edification of his Church,</hi> that there ſhould be Varieties in the uſe of Indifferencies; and ſo far from the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it (as ſome men would have it) that it's as conducible to the Splendour and Beauty of <hi>his Workmanſhip,</hi> as the Variety of complexions and diſpoſitions of Men to the old Creation. Now for men to place <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> of the Church in thoſe things that Chriſt never placed it in, is no <hi>ſmall reflection</hi> on his Wiſdome and Prerogative; for nothing carries more Evidence with it, than
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:135610:41"/>that thoſe things that he left <hi>indifferent,</hi> he intended neither <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> or Church ſhould be determined <hi>ad unum</hi> in, by any, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Worſhip; but that they ſhould be <hi>varied</hi> at the diſcretions of <hi>particular Churches and Chriſtians,</hi> and that ſuch variety ſhould be of advantage to <hi>Edification,</hi> and not that it ſhould be beſpattered with the foul names of <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> when ſuch uſe their Liberty in this kinde.</p>
            <p>§ 9. But ſuppoſe ſuch a thing had any probability to be the minde of Chriſt: Was it ever <hi>attained,</hi> or is it <hi>attainable,</hi> that there ſhould be <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in the uſe of Indifferencies,</hi> that <hi>all Churches</hi> and particular Chriſtians had the ſame Sentiments, and went the ſame way in the uſe of indifferent things; or is it poſſible to bring men to it? Or if they were brought to it, what advantage would accrue? Would it not prove a great <hi>diſadvantage?</hi> But ſome men plead, That ſome indifferent things ſhould be made neceſſary, as the very <hi>terms of Communion,</hi> and in conformity unto theſe ſhould conſiſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.</hi> To which <hi>I anſwer;</hi> 1. That this is but a <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Project.</hi> 2. That if Chriſt had approved ſuch a way (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author of Peace in his Church, and not of confuſion) he would have allotted it, and told us what the Indifferencies ſhould be, and who ſhould have had <hi>a deputation</hi> to make them <hi>Neceſſities and Conditions of Communion for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.</hi> But 3ly. He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Ordinances</hi> enough of this nature, and choſen out thoſe things himſelf wherein the Uniformity of his Church ſhould <hi>conſiſt,</hi> the <hi>Word, Sacraments and Prayer;</hi> and all Churches that do walk in theſe according to Goſpel-Rules, are Uniform, have Ceremonies enough, and have no need of ſetting a new Mint on work.</p>
            <p>§ 10. And ſuppoſe that ſuch a thing were <hi>attainable,</hi> that there were an agreement in the whole Catholick Church about ſome little <hi>External Ceremonies,</hi> what they ſhould be, and how uſed; Would this abundantly anſwer the nature and end of a right Uniformity in the Church? Would it cure <hi>all Schiſms,</hi> or <hi>prevent them?</hi> Would it keep the mindes of men in a due <hi>proportion</hi> to each others? Would it maintain <hi>Purity</hi> of Doctrine and Worſhip, and expel all <hi>Pollutions and Corruptions</hi> in both? I ſay, Nothing leſs. For we ſee by dayly Experience, it doth not do this in thoſe Churches where 'tis moſt <hi>zealouſly purſued:</hi> if we look but into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Proteſtant-Prelatick</hi> Churches, we ſee what great Errors and Hereſies in Doctrine, and Corruptions in Worſhip do abound, accompanied with <hi>irreconcileable Differences,</hi> and <hi>irreparable Breaches</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:135610:41"/>of communion in the higheſt and weightieſt matters wherein it is concerned; notwithſtanding the common conſent and agreement in the ſtreſs that they lay upon thoſe ſmall and trifling obſervances, and not on aberrations from ſound Doctrine, or defection from purity in that Worſhip which Chriſt himſelf hath inſtituted, which are to be bewailed as the great Schiſms in the Church, notwithſtanding all External Conformities.</p>
            <p>§ 11. But we muſt enquire out a better way of <hi>ſetling <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in the Church, more agreeing to the mind of Chriſt, and <hi>practicable</hi> in the nature of it; and therefore zealouſly to be purſued by all that love the Name and Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt; and that is, That all Churches <hi>walk by the ſame rule</hi> of the revealed Will of Chriſt, and ſubject themſelves to his Laws and Government; that they be <hi>uniform</hi> in all that he hath made neceſſary to be <hi>believed</hi> and <hi>practiſed,</hi> as in all things <hi>neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtians edification</hi> in matters of Communion, as in the word, Sacraments, Prayer, ſinging Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by all theſe, in worſhipping God in the Spirit, and not to trouble and diſtract their walk, and interrupt their Worſhip, with the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled, Multifarious, Brain-ſick Laws</hi> of Men, in inſtituted Worſhip, nor placing Uniformity in a heap of <hi>huskie, nauſeous Ceremonies.</hi> For the Rule being one, and the Law-giver one, all the true Churches of Chriſt will agree in <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> ſubmitting to one <hi>King,</hi> and conforming to one <hi>ſort</hi> of Laws; and though there may be ſome ſmall differences in their Interpretation of thoſe Laws determining things neceſſary, and the Exerciſe of diſcretion in things <hi>Expedient,</hi> becauſe of dubious and difficult circumſtances attending; yet all agree in the <hi>main things</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Chriſt, for the way of <hi>Salvation,</hi> and the main <hi>conditions</hi> of Communion. And it is not to be doubted, but that a Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing people, gathered together in the <hi>Name of Chriſt,</hi> injoying the Miniſtry of the <hi>Word and Sacraments</hi> in purity, are a Church of Chriſt, and uniform with all the Churches of Chriſt, without any diſtinction by this or that Name of <hi>Singularity,</hi> or any <hi>Ceremonial Appendixes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 12. And whereas it is pretended, that a <hi>full and free Conformity</hi> in Ceremonies would be the only cure of all our <hi>Differences</hi> and <hi>Diviſions;</hi> Let all Ages witneſs, if any will but impartially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what hath been the <hi>Grand Cauſe</hi> of all the <hi>Factions, Breaches, Diviſions</hi> and <hi>Schiſms</hi> in the Church, yea and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ever ſince the Primitive Times, it will be found to be the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation of this aforeſaid <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> of Chriſt, by ſome or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135610:42"/>other; and ſtill all the excuſe that is made for it is, that they aſſume this Power only in <hi>matters of Indifferency:</hi> and what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence can any make to <hi>a Legiſlative Power</hi> in things <hi>neceſſary</hi> already determined by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to one part? there is no place for a Law in ſuch things, unleſs it be to ratifie or to null the Law; ſo that what <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power</hi> is exerciſed of this kinde, muſt be in <hi>matters of Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency only, i. e.</hi> which are ſo in relation to Chriſt's Law antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to man's Law; but by the ſupervening of ſuch a Church-Law, it becomes in kinde Eccleſiaſtically neceſſary, it being enjoyn'd as to practice under <hi>Penalties annexed:</hi> and it's no new thing with ſome ſort of men to call <hi>neceſſary things indifferent,</hi> and <hi>indifferent neceſſary;</hi> and thereby take occaſion to juſtifie their preſumptions, when they make Laws even <hi>abrogatory</hi> to the known Laws of Chriſt: And if weak Brethren (as they are apt in deriſion to call them) either take any juſt exceptions againſt them <hi>pleading their Liberties,</hi> or it may be from a miſtaking judgment, are apt to call indifferent things neceſſary, and therefore out of tenderneſs of Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to yield acts of Obedience; they are ſo far from having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on <hi>their tenderneſs,</hi> that they exact the ſaid <hi>Law-penalty with greater violence</hi> and rigour, than they do any (that doth directly concern the Glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) eſtabliſhed by himſelf.</p>
            <p>§ 13. The greateſt Plea that I know can be made for matters of this kinde, is the power that <hi>Oecumenical Councils</hi> have taken upon them, eſpecially in the Primitive Times, even in the Apoſtle days, and in the firſt, ſecond, and third Centuries of the <hi>Church</hi> eſpecially. To which I anſwer; Firſt, If the Foundation of this Authority lie in <hi>Oecumenical Councels,</hi> let never any of theſe Church-Statutes be made and impoſed on the world but by them, and let not every particular National Independent Church take upon her to make <hi>Penal</hi> Laws, and gull the World into a ſubmiſſion to her Authority, by her ſaying ſhe is <hi>The Church;</hi> as if ſhe were the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> and <hi>Mother-Church.</hi> Secondly, I queſtion whether there were ever any true <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi> at all: much may be ſaid againſt the beſt that is pleaded for ſince the Apoſtles days; and it is eaſie to prove that Aſſembly at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> held by the Apoſtles and Brethren to be none, in the ſence intended; which is, that the chief Officers and Repreſentatives of every particular Church in the World meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with a <hi>determinating Power in matters of Doctrine,</hi> and with a binding <hi>Legiſlative Power in matters of Diſcipline and Ceremony.</hi> Now it will appear, that that Aſſembly was not ſo (though there were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:135610:42"/>more reaſon for its being ſo, than for any other Aſſembly being ſo) neither ever was there any Aſſembly ſo impowred in the world of that nature.</p>
            <p>§ 14. That that Aſſembly <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. was no <hi>Oecumenical Council,</hi> is eaſie to judge, for there were but the Repreſentatives of two Churches, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch;</hi> and they of <hi>Antioch</hi> came to ask counſel, and to be reſolved, in matter of doubt, of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding moſt of them at preſent in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 2. The caſe in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was argued <hi>in foro Eccleſiae particularis,</hi> and the Apoſtles making the minde of <hi>Chriſt</hi> manifeſt to that Church, have the conſent of the Brethren to their determination, and ſent it forth in and with the Authority of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 3. The Apoſtles and Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> changed no <hi>Indifferencies into Neceſſities;</hi> but enquired after, and found out the Will of <hi>Chriſt</hi> concerning the preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſtate of the Goſpel-church, in ſome matter of things neceſſary of two ſorts; ſome <hi>Abſolutely and Morally</hi> ſo, others <hi>expediently</hi> ſo for that time. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Abſolutely ſuch, as Abſtinence from Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and things offered to Idols. Secondly, <hi>Reſpectively</hi> only, and that in the behalf of the believing Jews, coming lately from that Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogy, that they might not be <hi>ſcandalized or grieved</hi> at the freedom of the Gentiles; and therefore that the Gentiles ſhould then abſtain from things <hi>ſtrangled and Blood:</hi> Now no ſound Interpeter will ſay, that this <hi>Canon</hi> was binding to the Church <hi>ſemper &amp; ubique;</hi> but in behalf only of th Jews, who could not ſo eaſily at preſent be brought off from the whole of Judaiſme; and 'tis likely by this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> the Apoſtles got off the Jewiſh Believers from many <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Obſervations</hi> which they ſtood upon beſides, or at leaſt abated their edge towards them. And therefore the Decree was but as to <hi>a neceſſary Expediency for a time,</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates, who was well acquainted with the Minde of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Judgments of the Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren, in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>§ 15. As we have little evidence for an <hi>Oecumenical Council exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing a Legiſlative Juriſdiction in the Church,</hi> ſo we have as little ground for ſuch ſorts of <hi>Officers</hi> as are contended for in the Church, of which ſuch Councils (as they are pleaded for) ſhould principally conſiſt, which are <hi>Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Prieſts;</hi> and there being not ſuch Officers in the Church by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, there is no ſuch Power to be exerciſed in the ſaid way and manner of <hi>Legiſlation,</hi> neither may they <hi>jure</hi> proceed ſo far as to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:135610:43"/>Execution of any Laws eſtabliſhed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being not lawfully <hi>commiſſionated</hi> with a Goſpel-power. If this Aſſertion be proved, I doubt not but it will be granted, that there is no Legiſlation to be exerciſed in the Church, the preſent Aſſertors whereof challenging this Power only on the behalf of the ſaid Officers. I lay down two things by way of proof; 1. That there is no ſuch Officers to be found (in the Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour) as <hi>a Pope, a Patriarch, a Metropolitan, an Archbiſhop, a Dioceſan Biſhop, a Pariſh-Prieſt,</hi> no <hi>Dean, Prebends, Canons,</hi> &amp;c. the Scriptures are altogether ſtrangers to all thoſe Eccleſiaſtical creatures; Chriſt and his Apoſtles knew nothing of them but prophetically in the foreſight of the riſe of the Kingdom of Antichriſt. In this <hi>Point</hi> I ſhould deal with two ſorts of men, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> As for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the caſe hath been fully managed over and over againſt them, that there is no ſuch <hi>Supreme Officer</hi> in or over the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as the <hi>Pope;</hi> and if there be no ſuch <hi>Monarchical Subſtitute</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt here on Earth, it will appear that all the reſt will fall to the ground. Therefore as to them I ſhall not <hi>actum agere;</hi> my principal part will be with the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that do aſſert ſuch Officers in the Church, and yet deny the <hi>Popes Supremacy.</hi> To whom I ſay in the ſecond place, and anon ſhall prove, that there cannot be any ſuch Officers (as above-mentioned) in the Church, without a <hi>Supreme Paſtor;</hi> thoſe Paſtors being <hi>Subordinate Paſtors of Subordinate Churches.</hi> And that this Queſtion may be cleared to every <hi>rational Proteſtant,</hi> that is not fanatically blinded with <hi>Pride, Ignorance and Intereſt,</hi> I ſhall crave leave of my Reader, in a ſhort Digreſſion, to handle this Queſtion, <hi>Whether a Subordination of Paſtors in the Church, doth not neceſſarily infer a Supreme Paſtor.</hi>

AMong the many Difficulties and inevitable Rocks that the <hi>Proteſtant Prelacy</hi> is neceſſitated upon, (by caſting off the <hi>Headſhip of the Oecumenical Paſtor</hi>) not only in aſſerting, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting their <hi>Epiſcopal Juriſdiction,</hi> or Paſtoral Power, in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:135610:43"/>and Execution Eccleſiaſtical pretended unto; I thought it not amiſs to debate one <hi>main Queſtion,</hi> wherein ſome part of the greateſt ſtreſs of difficulty in that kinde doth conſiſt, and that is this;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the aſſerting the Subordination of Paſtors in the Church, doth not by all good conſequence infer the Supremacy of an Oecumenical, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Paſtor?</hi> We underſtand the word, <hi>Church,</hi> here, as before explained, <hi>i. e.</hi> when we ſay <hi>(The Church)</hi> by way of <hi>eminency,</hi> we underſtand not (or ſhould not at leaſt) any <hi>Individual, Parochial, Dioceſan, Provincial, National, Congregational,</hi> or <hi>Claſſical Church,</hi> but the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> comprehenſive of all theſe, and enfolding them, as the outmoſt skin of an Onion involves all the other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately one within another. By an <hi>Oecumenical Paſtor</hi> is meant a Paſtor of the higheſt degree here on Earth, related in his Paſtoral charge to the whole viſible Church, by whatſoever Names, Titles, or Dignities he is known, and is a Biſhop in the <hi>higheſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence</hi> of Eccleſiaſtical Rule and Juriſdiction here on Earth, from whom there can be <hi>no Appeal</hi> to any <hi>Earthly Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi> and this is the <hi>Militant Paſtor</hi> of the Church-Catholick Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, to which (according to their ſuppoſition of <hi>Subordinated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,</hi> all the other Degrees and Orders muſt be ſubjected.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Supremacy of an Oecumenical Paſtor or Biſhop.</hi> And I prove it thus:</p>
            <p>§ 2. There is the ſame <hi>Political Reaſon</hi> for an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Paſtor,</hi> or Supreme Head on Earth over all other Paſtors and Churches, that there is for any Subordinate Paſtor that hath other Paſtors ſubjected unto him. Inſtance in a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop,</hi> ruling his Pariſh-prieſts, or Parochial Paſtors (if they may be allowed any higher title than the Biſhops Curates) the chief end of the ſaid Biſhop being Juriſdiction, Determination of Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, Regulation and Ordination of his Clergy, Unity, Order, Uniformity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By the ſame <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Reaſon,</hi> though in a <hi>higher Sphere</hi> of Government, is an <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,</hi> or <hi>Provincial Paſtor,</hi> required for regulation of Biſhops of Dioceſſes committed to his charge, maintaining the Unity of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:135610:44"/>
               <hi>Provincial Church, Order</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> therein, that every weak giddy-headed Biſhop may not govern after the Fancies of his own brain; but that every one ſhould be (notwithſtanding all their <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Grandeur</hi>) accountable to the Archbiſhop, for any male-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Government, or neglect of charge committed to their care. The reaſon holds good in like ſort for <hi>a National Paſtor,</hi> the <hi>Metropolitan, Primate,</hi> or <hi>Patriarch;</hi> that the whole National Church conſiſting of Provinces, divided into Dioceſſes, and they into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, be maintained <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform</hi> in Worſhip, and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> under one <hi>National Eccleſiaſtical Head</hi> and Governour, to whom the ſupreme Adminiſtration of Paſtoral Function in the Church National ſhould belong, as to overſee nextly and more <hi>immediately</hi> the <hi>Provincial Paſtors and Churches;</hi> and more remotely, all other Paſtors and Churches in the Nation, that there be no Diviſions, Schiſms, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Contempts, diſorderly Converſation, irregular proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Paſtors and People, but an harmonious concatenation from the higheſt to the loweſt, to whom and his Commiſſion-courts all Appeals from Inferiour Provincials and Dioceſans may be made. The Subordination of Paſtors thus far allowed and granted, an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Paſtor muſt be inferred by unavoidable conſequence. For as yet there is the like neceſſity of uniting National Churches, in one Univerſal Church under one <hi>Catholick Paſtor,</hi> as was for uniting Provincial Churches in a Nation, and ſubjecting them to a <hi>National Paſtor</hi> or <hi>Primate,</hi> or ſubjecting Dioceſſes and their reſpective Biſhops to an <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> or <hi>Provincial Paſtor, &amp; ſic deineeps.</hi> For by how much the more <hi>univerſal</hi> the Church is, by ſo much the more <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> the Paſtoral Charge and Juriſdiction muſt be: And as the <hi>National</hi> is to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Viſible Church,</hi> ſo the <hi>National Paſtor</hi> to the <hi>Catholick Paſtor,</hi> by a Mathematical Proportion. And the like ground of relation as is betwixt a <hi>National Paſtor</hi> and a <hi>National Church,</hi> conſiſting nextly of Provinces, is alſo betwixt an <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Paſtor</hi> and <hi>an Oecumenical Church</hi> conſiſting nextly of Nations. And if Unity, Uniformity, and regular Adminiſtration of Church-Government be indiſpenſably neceſſary in a <hi>National Church,</hi> and the care of theſe things to be committed primarily and principally to a National Paſtor; how much more is it neceſſary in the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> conſtituted and made up of <hi>National Churches</hi> nextly, the care of which to be committed to an <hi>Oecumenical Paſtor?</hi> And if the <hi>Schiſme</hi> of a Province or Dioceſs be of ſo dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to a <hi>National Church;</hi> of how much more dangerous will
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:135610:44"/>the Schiſme of a <hi>National</hi> from the Catholick Church be?</p>
            <p>§ 3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I prove that they that maintain the Government of the Church by <hi>Biſhops, Archbiſhops and Primates,</hi> muſt alſo own an Univerſal Viſible Paſtor, from the nature of the <hi>Catholick Viſible Church.</hi> 1. It muſt be either an <hi>organized or unorganized</hi> Body, and made up of <hi>partes ſimilares</hi> only; the latter will not be owned by ſuch Aſſertors, by reaſon of the groſs Abſurdities, tending to Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Phanaticiſme, that muſt neceſſarily be inferred on ſuch a conceſſion. If they ſay, it is an <hi>Organized Body,</hi> which is moſt ſuitable to the <hi>Grandeur and Splendour of Mother Church,</hi> that ſhe ſhould be made up of the moſt <hi>curious texture,</hi> and the moſt <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate adaptation of parts;</hi> it is by no means to be ſuppoſed, that a viſible Body, eminent in all other parts, ſhould be <hi>Corpus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum animatum,</hi> and yet <hi>want a Viſible Head;</hi> an <hi>Inviſible Headſhip</hi> to a viſible, organized, living Body, cannot be in this ſence allowed, nor a Secular Headſhip to this Spiritual Body. But more of this anon. Again, The <hi>Catholick Church</hi> muſt be ſuch, either <hi>quatenus Integrum,</hi> or <hi>quatnus Genus:</hi> it cannot have any other due <hi>Logical</hi> conſideration, though to adapt words to ſome novel apprehenſions, we ſpeak of <hi>totum aggregatum, &amp; totum comprehenſivum,</hi> both of which are reducible to the other Terms. I ſhall prove that both theſe acceptations of a Catholick Church do of neceſſity enforce an Univerſal Viſible Paſtor. 1. As <hi>Catholicum integrum,</hi> and <hi>quatenus tale,</hi> is to be conſidered as diviſible, or divided into parts, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Nation of <hi>Subordination,</hi> the greater parts into the next leſſer, and them into leſſer or leaſt of all; wherefore the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Viſible Church is divided into <hi>National Churches,</hi> as the next and greateſt conſtituting parts, <hi>National</hi> into <hi>Provincials, Provincial</hi> into <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> and they into <hi>Parochial;</hi> if there be <hi>a Subordination of Paſtors</hi> in the Church, it's according to the fubordination of the <hi>integral parts</hi> of the ſaid Church. For in Diviſion and Subdiviſion of parts, there muſt be <hi>a continuance</hi> till we come to <hi>minimum quod ſic</hi> on the deſcending part, and <hi>maximum quod ſic</hi> in the aſcending part. But there can be no ſuch Subordination of Paſtors, according to the <hi>Subordination of Membra totius,</hi> without an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Paſtor; Ergo.</hi> For as there is the ſame Reaſon of the <hi>Catholick</hi> to the <hi>National Church, (reſpectu ſaltem integrationis)</hi> which is of the <hi>National</hi> to the <hi>Provincial,</hi> and thence downward: So there is the ſame reaſon for an <hi>Oecumenical Paſtor</hi> to the <hi>National,</hi> as of the <hi>National</hi> to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial,</hi> or that to the <hi>Dioceſan Paſtor.</hi> As the <hi>National</hi> is the <hi>totum</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:135610:45"/>in reſpect of the Provinces, and as ſuch hath <hi>a Paſtor;</hi> ſo it's but an Integral part in reſpect of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which by the ſame reaſon is to have a Paſtor, elſe this <hi>concatenation</hi> by Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be headleſs, and viſibly deficient in the <hi>polity</hi> of its <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform Conſtitution,</hi> for pretended eſtabliſhment of Uniformity. Now if they plead that the Catholick Church is but <hi>totum aggregatum; Ergo</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Churches are <hi>coordinate,</hi> hence <hi>individual,</hi> thenceforward for their defence they muſt plead for <hi>Independency,</hi> and it will be <hi>coincident</hi> with the notion of <hi>Congregational Churches.</hi> But how inconſiſtent theſe Principles are, to deny a <hi>Subordination</hi> of National Churches and Paſtors to a Catholick Church and Paſtor, when they allow and maintain a Subordination of Churches and Paſtors within the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and utterly diſown an Independency of Paſtors of <hi>particular Congregations</hi> on ſuperiour Paſtors and Churches.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> be underſtood to be <hi>Genus Generaliſſimum</hi> diviſible into <hi>Species,</hi> the ſame Inference will accrue; for the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination</hi> ſtands thus: the <hi>National</hi> is <hi>ſubalternum Genus,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial <hi>ſubalterna Species,</hi> the Dioceſan <hi>Species ſpecialiſſima</hi> (according to ſome <hi>Logick</hi>) but <hi>Species ſpecialior</hi> (according to others,) and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Churches <hi>Species ſpecialiſſima;</hi> after this conſideration the Argument ſtands thus: If a Paſtor is to be ſet over a Church <hi>ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terni Generis,</hi> becauſe it comprehends Churches under it as <hi>Species,</hi> by the ſame reaſon a Paſtor is to be ſet over the <hi>Catholick</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending alſo its <hi>Species, viz.</hi> National Churches. For though the National Church be related to the provincial as <hi>Genus,</hi> it is related to the Catholick as <hi>Species.</hi> But becauſe according to the beſt Logical and Theological Notions, the application of <hi>Genus</hi> doth not well ſuit to the nature of the Catholick Church, it being more properly a <hi>totum Integrale,</hi> I ſtay not on this part of the Argument.</p>
            <p>§ 4. <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. I Argue from the nature of <hi>Subordination,</hi> which always ſuppoſeth a <hi>Supremum</hi> and <hi>Infimum;</hi> a <hi>Supreme</hi> higher than which is none, and a <hi>Loweſt</hi> lower than which is <hi>none;</hi> otherwiſe it would be unlimited. And if in the Church there be a Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Paſtors, then as there is a <hi>Loweſt,</hi> viz. <hi>a Pariſh-Prieſt,</hi> ſo there muſt be alſo <hi>a Supreme Paſtor</hi> for the higheſt Round of the Ladder, viz. <hi>an Oecumenical Paſtor:</hi> For as every <hi>Subordination</hi> is to be continued to a <hi>nè plus ultra,</hi> ſo Subordination of <hi>Paſtors</hi> muſt be continued to the largeſt acceptation of a Church on Earth, for the maintaining Unity and Uniformity of the <hi>National</hi> Churches, which are next in conſtitution to the <hi>Catholick.</hi> If it be ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:135610:45"/>is the onely Paſtor of the <hi>univerſal Church;</hi> It will be granted that he is Paſtor of the Church in the moſt <hi>Catholick acceptation,</hi> as it comprehends the Church <hi>viſible and inviſible;</hi> but for the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> he leaves it perfect, as to parts, with a <hi>viſible Head,</hi> as well as other parts viſible: for it muſt be <hi>ejuſdem naturae cum caeteris mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris,</hi> and how can viſible <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> be attained in the Catholick Church, but by a government of a <hi>viſible Paſtor,</hi> who viſibly rules all Churches, and in whom they are all <hi>politically</hi> knit together, as in a <hi>Central</hi> or rather <hi>Circumferential Knot?</hi> Beſides, if a <hi>National Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> be Supream among Paſtors, next under Chriſt, then it follows that this Subordination terminates at leaſt in a <hi>co-ordination of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors;</hi> and if ſo, it's becauſe there is a <hi>co-ordination of Churches:</hi> and if one ſort of Churches, and Paſtors of particular Churches, are <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> next under Chriſt the <hi>Head,</hi> why <hi>are not all?</hi> And why may not a <hi>Schiſmatical Provincial or Dioceſan</hi> uſe the like plea to throw off the juriſdiction of the <hi>National;</hi> or why may not particular Parochial Aſſemblies and their Paſtors, argue on the ſame grounds their <hi>Co-ordination</hi> and freedom from <hi>Subordination</hi> to any Paſtor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Chriſt alone? So that this <hi>National Co-ordination</hi> of Paſtors, in the higheſt Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy, is the making a hundred Popes inſtead of one, and laying the foundation of <hi>Independency</hi> unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably to all judicious underſtandings. The ſum of this whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, That there can be no plauſible reaſon given why the <hi>Subordination of viſible Paſtors</hi> ſhould not extend as far as <hi>viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> and if Chriſt hath ſet <hi>Orb within Orb,</hi> Church within Church, &amp; every one its Planet to rule it for the maintaining Order, Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why ſhould the <hi>Supream Planetary Orb be without a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 5. <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The neceſſity of this inference is further proved from the <hi>derivation or original of Paſtoral power:</hi> every Paſtor receives his <hi>Paſtoral power</hi> from Chriſt, <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately.</hi> If Subordinate Paſtors, they receive their power <hi>mediately;</hi> then <hi>mediante populo vel Superiori quodam.</hi> The Aſſertors of Prelacy will never grant a deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of power from Chriſt <hi>mediante populo;</hi> for that were to fall into the <hi>Congregational way.</hi> If they ſay they receive their power through the hands of <hi>ſome Superiour,</hi> it muſt be by ſome <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Civil Officers;</hi> if by ſome <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> then thorow ſome <hi>Paſtor</hi> or <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and they either <hi>co-ordinate,</hi> or of ſome <hi>ſuperiour</hi> Rank and Dignity. They will not ſay they receive their power from <hi>co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Paſtors; for that were to fall on the Rock of <hi>Presbytery:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:135610:46"/>they muſt ſay, and do ſay, That every ordinary <hi>Proteſtant Prieſt</hi> receives his power from Chriſt, thorough the hands of ſome <hi>ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Paſtor</hi> not <hi>co-ordinate;</hi> and then we muſt needs finde out the derivation of that ſuperiour power from one above him in <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> and at laſt muſt needs arrive at <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair and his Succeſſors, who firſt received this power from Chriſt; and ſo it's handed down through his reſpective <hi>ſubordinate</hi> Officers, to thoſe of the loweſt rank and degree. For if the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſt</hi> receive his Office from the <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> then he from the <hi>Provincial,</hi> and he from the <hi>Primate,</hi> and he from the <hi>Oecumenical.</hi> If they the <hi>Primates</hi> receive their power mediately by the hands of ſome others beſides the Oecumenical Paſtor, it muſt be from the <hi>co-ordinate</hi> power of ſome National Paſtor or Paſtors; and conſequently it will infer a <hi>Presbytery</hi> of Primates, which may prove of as ill and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Aſpect</hi> on the Church Catholick, than the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Aſſembly on the Church National; or it muſt be that he receive his Dignity from the Suffrage of his inferiour Clergy. Then it follows, that a <hi>Metropolitan</hi> is inveſted with power in a meaner and more deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way than a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> or <hi>Pariſh-Prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 6. To avoid ſplitting on the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> they finde another way of deriving their power from Chriſt; and that is, by the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> without the Church, as it is practically at leaſt granted. To which I ſay, That although he is or may be a Member of the Church, yet <hi>quatenus a Magiſtrate</hi> he is a Member of another State, and therefore in an Office <hi>extrinſecal</hi> to the Church; and hence cannot extend <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> to the Church, nor inveſt an Officer in the Church (which is Chriſt's dominion) with Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Power Legiſlative or Executive; the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical States being diſtinct from each other as they are ſuch. Moreover, for an Officer in Chriſt's ſtate to derive his power from Earthly <hi>Potentates,</hi> is to ſubject the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> as ſuch, to the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of men,</hi> and make it <hi>ſubordinate</hi> thereto in thoſe things which Chriſt hath reſerved to himſelf, as <hi>his Prerogative.</hi> Again, if Church-Officers, as ſuch, muſt be inveſted with power from <hi>Secular Princes,</hi> the Church muſt ſtand or fall, as to its right and orderly manner of Government, at the will and diſpoſition of Princes: Whence <hi>Chriſts Oeconomy</hi> will ſeem not compleat in it ſelf, but lame, deficient, and headleſs, in that it muſt be beholding to an <hi>Exotick Power</hi> for its principal Officers and Rulers; and Chriſt was wanting in not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the due governance of his Church under heatheniſh or
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:135610:46"/>heretical Magiſtrates; yea, ſuch Magiſtrates would undoubtedly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh Church-Officers <hi>ejuſdem farinae with themſelves:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it would follow, that the <hi>Primitive Churches,</hi> after our Saviour's aſcention, could have no due derivation of Church-power unto it for ſome Ages, for want of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, the grand <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums</hi> of Conveyance. There is alſo as much reaſon that <hi>Civil Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> ſhould be at the diſpoſition of the <hi>Church,</hi> as that <hi>Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> ſhould be at the diſpoſition of the <hi>State:</hi> And the <hi>Oecumenical Biſhop</hi> may upon as good grounds claim a power of enthroning Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, as the other claim an Eccleſiaſtical power of ſetting a <hi>Head</hi> over the Church, Chriſt having made <hi>Church and State Co-ordinate.</hi> Laſtly, if <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Officers</hi> derive their power from <hi>Civil Authority,</hi> as their viſible Church-head, ſure the Vitals and the whole Animati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needs be <hi>Secular;</hi> much like the Beaſt ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.4.</p>
            <p>§ 7. <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. I argue from the <hi>chief ends</hi> of Subordination of Paſtors in the Church. It's to redreſs <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or <hi>male Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of diſcipline, that there may be place for <hi>Appeals,</hi> in caſe of Injuſtice, determination of Controverſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now what end would there be of <hi>Appeals,</hi> if there ſhould not be ſome <hi>Paſtor</hi> ſupream to all the reſt, from whom there could be no <hi>Appeal?</hi> And it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary there be ſtill room for <hi>Appeal,</hi> till a man comes to the Church in its greateſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Superiority;</hi> and there is <hi>Mother-Church</hi> in her <hi>Grandeur, Eccleſia in Cathedrâ:</hi> if the reſort be made for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, or reſolution of difficult caſes to the Church in her <hi>Paſtoral multiplicity,</hi> there will be ſuch variety of Judgments and Intereſts, that there will be no final determination, but ye may hear the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> body ſpeaking one thing in its <hi>Catholick Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Head:</hi> for if you will know a mans minde and determination of any thing, you will go to the Head, not to the Arms or Legs; and what you have by <hi>Signes</hi> from them, you know is by the influence of the Head. So if we will know the minde of the <hi>Church</hi> in its ultimate Reſults and Determination, you muſt not go to a <hi>Dioceſan, Primate,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. where you will have but a partial or weak reſolution, not having a <hi>Catholick Intereſt, Intilligence, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,</hi> and <hi>Concernment;</hi> but we muſt go to the Body, ſpeaking in the Head, who hath a <hi>common Concern</hi> and <hi>Fellow-feeling</hi> with the leaſt Finger or Toe complaining or appealing to it.</p>
            <p>§ 8. Hence ſee the reaſon why the attribute of <hi>Infallibility</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Church, thus ſpeaking in its <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Supream Paſtor.</hi> 1. Becauſe of his univerſal Relation and Intereſt; and therefore
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:135610:47"/>ſpeaks infallibly the ſenſe of the whole, or of any particular part; as the Head feels and cannot be deceived in declaring the pain of the Toe, and can moſt <hi>infallibly,</hi> of all the members, preſcribe a Remedy. 2. It's moſt probable that he that hath his authority by <hi>immediate conveyance</hi> from Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould have alſo the moſt <hi>immediate diſcovery</hi> of his Minde and Will: ſo that the infallibility of an Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Paſtor is founded on the Principles of <hi>Epiſcopal government, viz.</hi> ſubordination of Paſtors in the Church; for if in all our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals from Paſtor to Paſtor, from Church to Church, for determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in matters of controverſie, and reſolution in points of weight and difficulty, we do at laſt arrive at as fallible a Church and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor as at firſt, to what purpoſe is all our Appeals? And if it be granted that a Biſhop is leſs <hi>fallible</hi> than a Pariſh-Prieſt, and an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop leſs <hi>fallible</hi> than a Biſhop, and a Primate than an Archbiſhop, then upon this account onely it muſt be that he hath a greater ſhare by his place in the common intereſt of the Body, by the <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs</hi> of his power and relation, and being farther removed by his dignity from <hi>particular ſmall intereſts</hi> and <hi>private paſſions;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more likely to be more impartial, univerſal, and leſs fallible in his judgment, than other his inferiour and more limited Paſtors: And <hi>Ergo,</hi> upon the ſame reaſon it will follow, that an Oecumenical Biſhop <hi>is leaſt of all fallible;</hi> not but that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors may err, and have, but that as Supream Head in the moſt <hi>Catholick capacity,</hi> he is (<hi>comparatively</hi> to all other Paſtors ſubordinate) <hi>infallible.</hi> And it is the greateſt reaſon, that he that hath the greateſt <hi>Charge,</hi> ſhould have the <hi>beſt underſtanding</hi> to know how to manage it: And to what purpoſe is it for us to ſeek after further light by going to thoſe that the Church hath further entruſted, if they be not <hi>holier, wiſer,</hi> and <hi>juſter</hi> men than our ſelves; yea, than all their inferiour Officers? And what is it we aim at moſt in ſuch Enquiries? is it <hi>Fallibility,</hi> or <hi>Infallibility?</hi> Would any one in his beſt wits be deceived? and would the Church deceive any, but uſe the beſt ways and means for enlightning mens Underſtandings, and reducing them from darkneſs and errour?</p>
            <p>§ 9. <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. I argue from the nature of the Church, in which this <hi>Subordination</hi> is required. That Church muſt be underſtood to be the <hi>univerſal viſible Church,</hi> and not any <hi>particular Church.</hi> 1. From the uſual acceptation of Church in the like ſence, when we ſay, <hi>The Church,</hi> with an Emphaſis. 2. There is no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Church ſhould be underſtood of one kind of particular
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:135610:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>Church more than another; a Provincial Church or Dioceſan may be called <hi>the Church,</hi> by way of eminency, as well as the National: and if there be more reaſon becauſe the National is comprehenſive of them, then much more that the <hi>Catholick</hi> ſhould be underſtood by it, becauſe it <hi>comprehends Nationals,</hi> and is moſt comprehenſive of all Churches on Earth. So that it will unavoidably follow, that if there be a Subordination of Paſtors in the Church, it is in <hi>the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church;</hi> and the more large the Church is, the more <hi>extenſive</hi> is the power of the Paſtor: and the moſt <hi>comprehenſive Church</hi> hath a ſupream Paſtor to the Paſtors of all other <hi>Churches ſubordinate</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the univerſal Church Viſible, is not <hi>Organical;</hi> and therefore not capable of an <hi>Oecumenical Paſtor. Anſw.</hi> It <hi>is Organical;</hi> for it's made up (according to our preſent Phainomena of a Church) of viſible, <hi>organized or organical</hi> parts comprehending each other; and therefore muſt needs have a viſible organical Head, <hi>principium ſenſus &amp; motus,</hi> animating all the parts in their reſpective Subordinations and Relations. It's abſurd to ſay, that the hand organized with fingers and joynts, the feet with toes and all its parts, and ſo of the other members, that theſe united in one body make not up an <hi>orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized body,</hi> and have not one <hi>Head</hi> common to the <hi>totum,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate reſpective vigor to each of theſe members. So to ſay that in the Church there is National Churches <hi>organized,</hi> &amp;c. ſo Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dioceſan <hi>organized,</hi> and not that the univerſal Church viſible is <hi>organized</hi> with, and <hi>influenced by a viſible Head,</hi> is moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. Again, there is the ſame and greater reaſon upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned grounds, for the <hi>Organization</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> than for the <hi>organizing of a National, Provincial,</hi> or of any of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour <hi>Subordinate Churches:</hi> for if Order, and Uniformity, and due adminiſtration of Government cannot be maintained in one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by <hi>Organization,</hi> how can they by any other means be obtained in the other? And if Order, Uniformity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not onely comely and beautiful, but moſt neceſſary to the well-being of a <hi>National Church,</hi> and that the more, becauſe it is ſo <hi>comprehenſive</hi> of other Churches ſubordinated to it, how much more requiſite is it to the <hi>well-being of the Catholick Church,</hi> which <hi>comprehends</hi> National and all others?</p>
            <p>§ 10. <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. That this <hi>Catholick Headſhip</hi> is inſeparable from a co-ordination of Paſtors in the Church, may be evinced from theſe following Neceſſities. 1. <hi>A neceſſity of a Catholick judgment of Schiſm.</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:135610:48"/>2. <hi>Of a Catholick interpretation of Scripture, it being not of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</hi> 3. <hi>Of a Catholick determination of Decencies and Order.</hi> 4. <hi>A Catholick compoſure of the Prayers of the Church.</hi> 5. <hi>A Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Canonization of Saints.</hi> 6. <hi>A Catholick convention or call of Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 11. The firſt <hi>Neceſſity</hi> is for a <hi>Catholick judgment of Schiſm:</hi> for if it be not determined by a <hi>Catholick judgment,</hi> theſe abſurdities will follow: 1. National Churches may be <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge of them, it being not fit that one National Church ſhould judge another, they being <hi>co-ordinate,</hi> equally concerned, of equal authority, latitude, and fallibility: Neither may a <hi>Provincial</hi> be judge of National Schiſm, they being <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to the National, and included in it; for they are bound up in the determination of the National, and is accountable to it: and if it declares againſt the National, as guilty of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and upon that account ſeparates from it, ſhe ſhall be judged as <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> from the National; and ſo <hi>Schiſm</hi> will be committed on <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and none healed. 2. If there be no Catholick <hi>determination</hi> of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> there can be no Catholick <hi>puniſhment</hi> of <hi>Schiſm</hi> from the Catholick Church; for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be preceded by a Law-determination. And hence, if a National Church be Schiſmatical from the Catholick, it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Catholick puniſhment; and it will follow, that ſuch a ſin may be committed in the Church, on which ſhe is not capable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a <hi>puniſhment</hi> in any meaſure proportionate to it. 3. If a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church</hi> hath power to judge of the <hi>Schiſm of a Provincial Church,</hi> and a <hi>Provincial Church of the Schiſm of a Dioceſan,</hi> and a Dioceſan <hi>of the Schiſm of a Parochial,</hi> then by <hi>the ſame reaſon may the Catholick Church judge of the Schiſm of a National Church;</hi> otherwiſe Schiſms will be equally multiplied with National Churches, and no redreſs to be made of them. 4. If there be not a <hi>Catholick determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Schiſm,</hi> all Churches will not be agreed about <hi>Schiſm:</hi> ſo that whilſt there is a perpetual controverſie in the Church what <hi>Schiſm is,</hi> and <hi>what is not,</hi> Schiſm perpetually remains, and falſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtill paſſed upon ſome Churches: theſe calling that a <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Church,</hi> which is not ſo; others owning another Church as not <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> which is <hi>really ſo.</hi> All which tends to a neceſſary and unavoidable confuſion, for want of a Catholick determination; whereas if it may determine by its <hi>viſible Head,</hi> all thoſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies would be ended: for if the members of the Body complain one of another, the <hi>whole Body</hi> muſt determine the matter by the <hi>Head,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:135610:48"/>where there is a concurrence of all parts for the good of the whole.</p>
            <p>§ 12. Secondly. From the neceſſity of a Catholick determination of <hi>dubious places of Scripture.</hi> This can be done by none but the Church Catholick on Earth: (for no <hi>Scripture being of private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> where ſhall ſuch an interpretation be found that is not <hi>private,</hi>) but in ſuch as is of the Catholick Church, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current judgment and faith of all Churches may be heard? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of <hi>private Solution,</hi> i. e. not of particular perſons, or Churches private Solution, but ſuch as is univerſal and commonly received by all Churches and Chriſtians, according to the analogy of faith. Now where can this be found and reſted in as Catholick, unleſs it be in the <hi>viſible univerſal Head?</hi> and if it be ſaid that a <hi>National Church</hi> may poſitively determine in this kind, then why not a <hi>Provincial</hi> as well, the one being a <hi>ſubordinate</hi> Church as well as the other? But if the Decree be onely National, as many <hi>various</hi> interpretations and ſences may be put on a place of Scripture, as there are Nations; which will lay an ample foundation for variety of <hi>Sects, Schiſms, Hereſies,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas if all National Churches were bound to one <hi>Catholick determination,</hi> there muſt needs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence enſue the admirable effect of Uniformity in <hi>Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi> all Churches believing as the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church believes,</hi> and that as the <hi>Head doth.</hi> Beſides, if it be of ſuch dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for Chriſtians, as private perſons, to put their interpretation on Scripture, in laying the foundation of variety of Sects, Schiſms, Hereſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how much more dangerous for particular Churches, becauſe the determination of a <hi>Church</hi> reacheth further, and is more attended unto, and more become <hi>ſeduced</hi> and <hi>leavened</hi> with errour thereby, if it be erroneous? Hence, to believe as the <hi>Catholick Church believes,</hi> hath more concern in it than thoſe imagine, that endeavour to blaſt it with the ridicle of the <hi>Colliers Faith;</hi> for it's not as the <hi>National Church believes,</hi> but as the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> believes: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it an <hi>implicit Faith</hi> in any things but controverſal and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious matters, above <hi>ordinary ſcrutiny</hi> and <hi>vulgar capacity;</hi> and therein we had better reſt ſatisfied in <hi>Catholick Authority,</hi> than run the risk of adhering to the Opinion of private perſons and Churches; which muſt be done alſo by an <hi>implicite Faith:</hi> and who is likely to have the moſt unerring Spirit, a Church or particular Perſon? and if a Church, the moſt Catholick is the moſt unerring.</p>
            <p>§ 13. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> From the Neceſſity of a Catholick determination of <hi>Decency and Order.</hi> That is <hi>decent,</hi> which by the Univerſality is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:135610:49"/>reputed and judged ſo; for one Countrey doth uſually call that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, which others repute undecent. And there are no Proteſtant Prelates but have, do, and will ſay, That Chriſt hath left it to the Church to determine all <hi>matters of Decency and Order;</hi> and 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay, that this or that Church may do it, when no ſuch is <hi>the Church</hi> eminently. When 'tis ſaid, the Church determines Decencies, What Church is that? <hi>Is it a Pariſh-Church?</hi> Nay then Pariſh-Churches ſhould rule <hi>Dioceſan</hi> by a Law. Again, if <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Churches ſhould have power to determine their <hi>Decencies,</hi> either <hi>Provincials</hi> muſt be ſubject to ſome one <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate <hi>all the reſt,</hi> or elſe <hi>Dioceſan Churches</hi> would differ ſo much in their <hi>decencies,</hi> that there would be no Uniformity in the <hi>Provincial Church.</hi> And if <hi>Provincials</hi> might determine each one its <hi>Decencies and Order,</hi> it muſt needs break <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in National Churches. But I know where the Proteſtant <hi>Prelate</hi> will be; he will ſay pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, it's the <hi>National Church</hi> that he means, when he ſpeaks of the Churches determination of <hi>Decency and Order.</hi> To which I reply, that he may with as good ground ſay, that he means <hi>a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Church;</hi> and that by giving this power to <hi>a National Church,</hi> he gives a greater advantage to <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and lays a greater bar againſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity:</hi> For the more <hi>comprehenſive</hi> the Church is, in which the <hi>Schiſm</hi> is, the greater it is; and the more <hi>uniform</hi> the Schiſmatical Church is, of the more dangerous conſequence it is to the Catholick Church. In vain do men plead for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in the Church, who in aſſerting the principles of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in a National Church, do thereby <hi>extirpate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in the Catholick; for <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> unleſs it be <hi>Catholick,</hi> is but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in a Schiſm.</hi> For if every National Church may determine of <hi>Decency and Order,</hi> there will be as great a <hi>diverſity,</hi> if not <hi>contrariety,</hi> in ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches affairs, as in the affairs of ſeveral States, one Nation deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that Ceremony to be <hi>decent,</hi> which another determines to be <hi>undecent,</hi> abſurd, and diſorderly; and ſo Churches will be as divers in their <hi>Faſhions,</hi> as <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, Spaniard,</hi> &amp;c. And there will be no end of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and new-fangled Garbs in the Church, if a Nation may of themſelves, and when they will, conſtitute, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and appoint them at their pleaſure, alter and null old Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and invent new; and ſhall have as great difficulty, intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and multiplicity of Church-Laws, as State-Laws, if at every Convocation Decency, and Order may be determined.</p>
            <p>§ 14. From the neceſſity of <hi>a Catholick compoſure of Church-Prayers:</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:135610:49"/>the more private and ſingular the conception of Church-prayers are, the more <hi>Schiſmatical:</hi> And divers <hi>Liturgies</hi> in one and the ſame National Church may not be allowed, neither that every <hi>Province and Dioceſs</hi> compoſe their own Liturgy, as being a matter of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence to the National Church. How then comes it to paſs, that our National Church may compoſe its own <hi>Liturgy</hi> diſtinct from another; Is not this of as dangerous conſequence to the <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> And is't not more conducing to the Peace, Beauty, Uniformity and Honour of the Church, to have a <hi>Catholick Liturgy?</hi> Whereas otherwiſe every Nation will be ſetting up the price of their own prayers above others; whence ariſeth heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Diviſions, and Schiſms National, in the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> were it not much better that all Nations ſhould bring their <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and lay them down at the feet of <hi>Mother-Church,</hi> and ſubmit them to her Judgment in the <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> from whoſe bleſſed hands ſhe may receive one of ſuch <hi>Catholick compoſure,</hi> that might produce a perfect Harmony in the affections and petitions of all the Churches in the world, in good aſſurance of a <hi>Catholick Amen</hi> attending the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all? Beſides, if a National prayer be more available than a Provincial or Dioceſan, Why ſhould not a Catholick Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer be moſt of all available?</p>
            <p>§ 15. <hi>Fifthly.</hi> The neceſſity of a Catholick <hi>Canonization of Saints.</hi> For ſuppoſing the Neceſſity of the <hi>Obſervation of Saints days,</hi> (as the Proteſtant Prelates zealouſly aſſert) it is requiſite to enquire, who or what Church <hi>Canonized</hi> the Saints which are already honoured with <hi>Saintſhip Titular,</hi> and <hi>Days</hi> devoted to their remembrance; and who dedicated and conſecrated Churches on the ſame account, was it not the Catholick Church, by her <hi>Catholick Paſtors?</hi> If every Church (ſuppoſe National) ſhould have the like liberty to <hi>canonize Saints</hi> at their pleaſure, all the days in the Year, yea in an Age, would be little enough for <hi>All Hollan-tide;</hi> And if the obſervation muſt be <hi>Anniverſary,</hi> there would be a neceſſity of robbing <hi>Peter to pay Paul,</hi> which would be <hi>doing evil, that good may come of it;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as great a ſin to rob <hi>Peter</hi> of his <hi>fiſhing-nets,</hi> as to rob <hi>Paul</hi> of his <hi>cloak and parchments.</hi> Beſides, this Abſurdity would fall in, that one Nation would <hi>canonize</hi> that for a Saint, which another would <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize</hi> to the Devil; As for Example, <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-day is devoted to St. <hi>Michael the Archangel,</hi> which Feaſt was inſtituted by <hi>Felix the Third,</hi> the 48th <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Biſhop. Now the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath preſumed to alter this Title and Inſtitution, making it a Feſtival
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:135610:50"/>to St. <hi>Michael and all Angels;</hi> which hath theſe groſs Abſurdities in it. 1. That St. <hi>Michael</hi> is greatly detracted from, in that all other <hi>Angels</hi> are introduced as ſharers in the Solemnity of the day; and <hi>all Angels</hi> may be underſtood of Bad, as well as Good, ſo that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> hereby become <hi>Canonized</hi> Saints. Now whereas it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that there be ſome Saints-days not of <hi>Catholick Obſervation,</hi> but only <hi>National,</hi> as St. <hi>Denis</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> St. <hi>George</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> St. <hi>Taffy</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> and St. <hi>Patrick</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> it bears no weight againſt us; for the <hi>Canonization is Catholick,</hi> and queſtionleſs the <hi>Obſervation</hi> ought to be ſo alſo: though there is a more <hi>peculiar</hi> and more <hi>proper Remembrance and Honour</hi> due from thoſe Nations, to which the Saints are <hi>appropriate;</hi> which <hi>peculiar Homage</hi> is enjoyn'd by the Church catholick. Moreover, it is meet that ſo ſolemn a matter ſhould be ratified by <hi>Catholick Authority,</hi> as the canonizing a Saint, and inſtituting a Feſtival day to be ſacred to his Remembrance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as ſhe will be moſt impartial and wiſe in ſuch appointments, ſo her Authority will make deeper <hi>impreſſions</hi> on the minds of men, to oblige them to the conſciencious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance: whereas particular Nations are liable to <hi>Errour and Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> each one being apt to be byaſſed by proper Intereſts, and to prefer the products of their own Soyl. Beſides the <hi>groſs Schiſm</hi> that it cauſeth in the Catholick Church, dividing the Churches in their Prayers at the ſame time, when one Nation ſhall obſerve that day to one Saint, and another to another, and a third to none at all. Whereas nothing is more honourable and neceſſary than <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> in this kinde, That as all ſay the ſame Prayers, they ſhould do it at the ſame Hours <hi>canonically</hi> appointed, uſe the ſame Ceremonies, obſerve the ſame <hi>Holidays;</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>Anniverſary</hi> ſhould at leaſt be of, Catholick Appointment: And though ſome Saint-days are more <hi>appropriate</hi> to one Nation than to another, by reaſon of the relation of this or that Saint to this or that Nation in particular, by Nativity, by <hi>Heroick Actions,</hi> or <hi>Meritorious Sufferings</hi> therein, yet is it not meet that <hi>all</hi> Churches ſhould rejoyce and keep Holy-day with <hi>one</hi> that rejoyceth? If the Rule of rejoycing with them that rejoyce reach particular Chriſtians, then much more Churches. And how can an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> but be mightily raviſhed with an <hi>holy Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,</hi> to ſee <hi>a Welſhman</hi> (zealouſly affected with the <hi>honour</hi> of St. <hi>Taffy</hi>) ſtrutting up and down with a green <hi>feather</hi> in his Cap? can he forbear the plucking up all the Leeks in his Garden, and calling all the Fidlers in the Town about him? And is it not fit, that St.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135610:50"/>
               <hi>Thomas à Becket</hi>'s day ſhould be honourably obſerved by all other Churches, as well as <hi>England,</hi> who engaged in and ſuffered for the common <hi>Catholick Cauſe</hi> oppoſed in this Church? If the Devoted day be peculiar to a Nation, as <hi>an Anniverſary Memorial</hi> of ſome great Deliverance ſuppoſed, it's fit it ſhould have its <hi>Sanction</hi> from the Catholick Church; otherwiſe National Churches may run into abſurd and <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> Obſervation of days, under ſuch pretences, to the great Scandal and Injury of the Catholick Church; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> a day Annually obſerved by a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church, to the great Scandal and Blemiſh of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> and <hi>Oecumenical Paſtor,</hi> in the ſence of the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 16. But ſome I hear will be ready to ſay, in order to theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary eſtabliſhments, there will be no need of <hi>a Catholick Paſtor,</hi> they may be done well enough by <hi>Oecumenical Councils.</hi> To which I reply, That then the Church acteth not as a <hi>Body Politick ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately</hi> knit together, but as <hi>totum aggregatum,</hi> or as an Aſſembly of <hi>Independent Paſtors</hi> by way of <hi>Aſſociation;</hi> whence many Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities will follow. 1. That all the convened Paſtors, of what Order or Degree ſoever, are co-ordinate at leaſt in the <hi>power pleaded for,</hi> and a Primate or Patriarch's Vote is no more than a Dioceſan's. 2. That the Church, in the utmoſt reſolution of its power, is but <hi>Ariſtocratical,</hi> which undermines Epiſcopal Principles. 3. If becauſe matters of greateſt concern in the Catholick Church are managed by an <hi>Oecumenical Council,</hi> therefore there needs no Oecumenical Paſtor; then by the ſame reaſon, all matters of the greateſt concern in a National Church, being handled in a <hi>National Synod,</hi> there ſhould be no need or uſe of a <hi>Primate;</hi> and <hi>ſic deinceps</hi> to Provinces and Dioceſſes, and ſo all Church-power would conſequently become co-ordinate in the hands of particular Paſtors. 4. What courſe could be taken in the <hi>Intervals</hi> of Councils for the Churches Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in its <hi>Catholick</hi> ſtate? 5. <hi>Diviſions and Schiſms</hi> have and will follow hereupon in the Church; for ſuppoſe the Council be equally divided in their voting about Scripture-<hi>Interpretation, Tradition, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> or <hi>Decencies,</hi> who ſhall determine in ſuch caſe? 6. Suppoſe the leſſer part divide from and declare againſt the greater and its proceedings, What Supreme Power is there <hi>Authoritatively</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them, <hi>Eccleſiaſtically</hi> to admoniſh and reduce the Erring part? 7. <hi>Oecumenical Councils</hi> cannot eaſily and preſently be convened, in caſe of emergent Church-difficulties, as in the ſudden Defection of <hi>a National Church</hi> or Paſtor to Schiſm or Hereſie, in the ſtarting up
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:135610:51"/>of new Sects, Canonization of new Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An Errour may ſpread itſelf ſoon over a whole Nation, before ſuch a Council can be called, and any remedy applied. 8. It is needful every Church do exerciſe its power in <hi>an unity,</hi> and not in <hi>a multiplicity;</hi> therefore there are National, Provincial, and Dioceſan Paſtors. Therefore there ſhould be a Catholick Paſtor to the Church catholick, for the avoiding the like <hi>Rocks and Precipices</hi> that other Churches would <hi>ſplit</hi> upon, if they had not their particular Heads and Paſtors.</p>
            <p>§ 17. <hi>Sixthly.</hi> We argue from the Neceſſity of <hi>calling and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Eccleſiaſtical Councils.</hi> In whoſe power is it to call an Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Council, if there be no Oecumenical Paſtor in the Church? For firſt, the Aſſemblies of every Church are to be <hi>convened</hi> only by the Paſtor of the ſaid Church; as in a Dioceſs, Who can <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively</hi> convene the Clergy, but the Biſhop of the Dioceſs? In a Province, Who can convene the Dioceſan Biſhops, but the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop? In a Nation, Who hath power <hi>Eccleſiaſtically</hi> to convene a National Synod, beſides the <hi>Metropolitan or Patriarch?</hi> ſo in the Catholick Church, who hath power <hi>Eccleſiaſtically</hi> to convene an <hi>Oecumenicul Council,</hi> but the Oecumenical Paſtor? It being a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral charge to convene or diſmiſs Church-Aſſemblies, and it is done by an <hi>Office-power. Object.</hi> Supreme Magiſtrates may call <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Councils. Anſw.</hi> They cannot by any <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Right; for conſidered as ſuch, they cannot exerciſe any <hi>Paſtoral Office.</hi> And an <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi> being the moſt eminent Church-Aſſembly, it is not to be convened in a more irregular or exotick way, than the inferiour Aſſemblies of <hi>Subordinate Churches.</hi> 2. It is not in the capacity of any one, or few Supreme Magiſtrates, to convene an <hi>Oecumenical Council;</hi> becauſe no Magiſtrate can by any civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, much leſs by any Eccleſiaſtical, (of which he hath none) call forth the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of another Nation to ſuch a Council: Whereas an <hi>Oecumenical Paſtor,</hi> whoſe Authority reaches equally to all National Churches, and to Magiſtrates as Members thereof, may <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively</hi> command the preſence of any <hi>Reverend Father</hi> whatſoever, and demand the conſent of the Magiſtrate thereto, under the pain of <hi>Church-cenſures;</hi> and to permit his Biſhops to aſſemble in or out of his Dominions; whereas there is no one or more Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate hath any <hi>univerſal tye Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> of other States and Dominions to his Juriſdiction; ſo that they are <hi>neceſſitated</hi> under any Law to ſubmit thereunto, unleſs ſuch which they have reduced unto <hi>Homage</hi> and <hi>Vaſſalage</hi> by dint of Sword, or ſuch as by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:135610:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>Subjection have yielded themſelves. 3. Magiſtrates have not then a Power to call an <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi> when they pleaſe; or if there were ſuch an Emperour (there never was or will be) that could in reſpect of his <hi>civil power</hi> do ſo, yet they have no <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power</hi> to do it <hi>authoritatively,</hi> but onely by concurrence or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; whereas all Church-Aſſemblies are authoritatively to be called by the Officers of the ſaid Church, or elſe they cannot act ſo when called by Aſſembled, unleſs we reduce Church-government unto a <hi>Democracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 18. <hi>Obj.</hi> It may be alſo ſaid, that an Oecumenical Council may be convened by the conſent of <hi>Patriarchs and Biſhops</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is no <hi>Authoritative way of aſſembling,</hi> (ſuch as Biſhops will always contend for) but onely <hi>precarious.</hi> 2. If they aſſemble this way, either it muſt be no Council till all be agreed, which may be long enough firſt; or any few agreeing to aſſemble, and give notice of ſuch reſolutions to others, (who are averſe to ſuch Propoſals) may gather together and call themſelves <hi>an Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Council;</hi> undertake to make Decrees, determine matters of conſequence, and impoſe on the diſſenting Churches. And what dangerous conſequence would this be of in the Church, eſpecially where <hi>Heretical Paſtors</hi> abound; as in the times of the <hi>Arrian, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian,</hi> and <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Hereſies? 3. If <hi>National Paſtors</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene by conſent to conſtitute an Oecumenical Council, why may not <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> convene by conſent to make up a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Synod without the Authoritative Call of the Primate? which will by no means be allowed.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. and laſtly, By whoſe authority ſhall a Catholick Aſſembly have its <hi>Sanction,</hi> if not by <hi>the Catholick Paſtor?</hi> for it's not every Council that calls it ſelf <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> that can or may be allowed to be ſuch; neither ever was there, or ever will be any ſo General, that all the Paſtors were aſſembled: But it is in this as in all other Church-Aſſemblies, if they be called <hi>by the Paſtor,</hi> and publick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given to all the Members of the time and place, the abſence of ſome alters not the nature of it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> there ſhould be an Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Paſtor for theſe ends and purpoſes.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of the Magiſtrates Power in matters of Religion.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. THe power of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in matters of Religion, hath been very much controverted, and variouſly determined by men of Learning and Conſcience. I ſhall not fill up theſe ſheets with tranſcribing other mens Sentiments; I ſhall onely propound what ſeems to me to be agreeable to Scripture and Reaſon, with as much perſpicuity and brevity as I can. There are three things for enquiry that will principally lie before us.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Whether the Civil Magiſtrate may exerciſe a Legiſlative power in matters Evangelically indifferent?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Whether in the execution of Eccleſiaſtical Juſtice, the ſword of the Magiſtrate may be uſed?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>What are the true bounds and limits of the Magiſtrates power in matters of Religion?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The firſt Queſtion is thus to be underſtood: <hi>Whether the Civil Magiſtrate may or can change things religiouſly indifferent, into neceſſities, by a competent Law? i.e.</hi> by a Law binding Conſcience <hi>primarily or ſecundarily,</hi> by Chriſt's authority, (for we have ſhewed that no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can reach Conſcience ſo as to binde it or looſe it, but <hi>Chriſt's alone</hi>) that being no competent Law that anſwers not the true nature of the obedience required; which is always expected here to be <hi>conſcientious.</hi> All Chriſt's Laws flowing from his peculiar <hi>Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive prerogative</hi> over his Church, have an <hi>immediate influence</hi> on Conſcience, and do <hi>primarily</hi> binde as ſuch. All juſt humane Laws do <hi>ſecundarily</hi> binde Conſcience, <hi>i. e.</hi> not <hi>quatenus humane;</hi> but they ſo far binde Conſcience, as men have derived ſuch authority from the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> for the compoſing and enacting the ſaid Laws. Now if the Magiſtrate cannot make a Law in one of theſe kinds to binde Chriſtians in <hi>matters indifferent,</hi> he cannot do it by a <hi>competent Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. Having thus explained the true meaning of our Enquiry, we determine in the <hi>Negative;</hi> and that for theſe following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. It's Chriſts <hi>peculiar prerogative</hi> to be the Lawgiver to his Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> to make ſuch Laws as <hi>immediately</hi> concerns it. He
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:135610:52"/>never gave this power to any, or commiſſionated any to exerciſe a <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority</hi> in this kind, as hath been abundantly ſhewn. He onely can do it. 1. He is the onely <hi>Spiritual King;</hi> there is no other <hi>mediate</hi> Spiritual King between him and his Church. 2. <hi>He knows</hi> onely what is fit to be the matter of ſuch a Law: <hi>He knows onely</hi> which way he will be worſhipped, and no way can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him but that which is of his <hi>immediate appointment;</hi> it's high preſumption in any other to preſcribe. 3. It's <hi>his Glory</hi> to reſerve this to himſelf, and he gives to Magiſtrates that power which they have; it's but reaſonable he ſhould reſerve to himſelf <hi>what he pleaſeth.</hi> 4. If Magiſtrates can exerciſe any ſuch power, it muſt be by <hi>deputation</hi> from Chriſt. If there be any ſuch, let them produce their Commiſſion; which cannot be pretended to in the New Teſtament: and what is ſaid of Magiſtrates power from the Old Teſtaments authority, will eaſily be refuted, if the particular caſes be duely conſidered; which I ſhall not now ſtay upon. 5. If Chriſt hath given ſuch a power to a <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate,</hi> it belongs to him as a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> or as a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> it doth not belong to him as a <hi>Civil Magiſtrate:</hi> for then, 1. As many ſorts of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> as the Church doth militate under, ſo many ſorts of <hi>Lawgivers</hi> in Spiritual things ſhe ſhould be ſubject to; whether <hi>Chriſtian, Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Prophane,</hi> or <hi>Heatheniſh:</hi> and as the government of State alters in the <hi>Supream Magiſtracy,</hi> ſo the Laws of the Church muſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>ſeveral intereſts</hi> and <hi>corrupt deſignes</hi> of the ſons of men. 2. The number and certainty of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Laws</hi> could never be known; for as he may make Laws, he may <hi>repeal Laws</hi> where they are of the ſame kind: So that there would be no certain <hi>ſtanding Rule</hi> for the worſhip of God, all being <hi>alterable</hi> in <hi>Addition or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,</hi> by the will and pleaſure of man. He may alter the Modes and Dreſſes of the Church in all matter of Ceremony at leaſt, that the Church will be liable to as many new faſhions as an Engliſh man: as <hi>one Magiſtrate</hi> may change his <hi>own Laws,</hi> ſo many will change <hi>one anothers;</hi> one, it may be, being <hi>Popiſh,</hi> another <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> a third a <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> So that if the Magiſtrates Laws muſt binde the Church <hi>Eccleſiaſtically,</hi> it may be bound and unbound a hundred times in a few years, and put on as many Shapes as <hi>Proteus:</hi> for ſtill as there is <hi>new Lords,</hi> ſo <hi>new Laws.</hi> But where there is a <hi>perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency</hi> and <hi>unchangeableneſs of Lords and Lawgivers,</hi> there will be a certainty and ſtability of Laws, as always under Chriſts <hi>immediate Legiſlation.</hi> 3. If this power be allowed to a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> as ſuch,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:135610:53"/>then to a <hi>Heathen Magiſtrate,</hi> and he may make Laws according to his <hi>Religion, viz.</hi> that Chriſtians ſhould <hi>eat Meat ſacrificed to Idols;</hi> which eating in it ſelf is an indifferency, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. But I would fain know whether any of the ſtrenuous Proteſtant-contenders for the Magiſtrates power in this kind, would not think it a great ſin both for the Magiſtrate to make ſuch a Law, and for any Subject knowing of it to obey him in it. Again, a <hi>Jewiſh Magiſtrate</hi> may make a Law that all ſhould <hi>be circumciſed,</hi> becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it to be but an <hi>Indifferency:</hi> after the abolition of the <hi>Jewiſh Law,</hi> a man might cut off his Foreskin or let it alone; <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was nothing,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion nothing;</hi> it was but the taking away or keeping a little fleſhie skin. But I would ask whether if any Magiſtrate ſhould make ſuch a Law that all the <hi>Males</hi> in his dominion ſhould be <hi>circumciſed,</hi> whether every conſcientious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian would not then ſuffer much, before he would be <hi>circumciſed?</hi> ſaying as <hi>Paul,</hi> That if they were <hi>circumciſed</hi> by virtue of ſuch an Impoſition, <hi>Chriſt would profit them nothing:</hi> And this is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine preached by him to the <hi>Galatians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. Chriſt hath not granted any ſuch power to a Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate as a <hi>Chriſtian merely;</hi> if ſo, it will follow, 1. That one Chriſtian may inſtitute a <hi>way or mode</hi> of Worſhip for another. 2. That <hi>a ſtrong Chriſtian</hi> being a Magiſtrate, may force the <hi>weak</hi> to uſe all thoſe things that he <hi>calls indifferent,</hi> though the other <hi>call them</hi> and <hi>reputes them unlawful and ſinful.</hi> 3. If the Scales of Providence turn, and the <hi>weak Chriſtian</hi> be made the Magiſtrate, he may pay home the ſtrong, and make a Law for him to puniſh him, if he uſe that as <hi>an Indifferency</hi> which he eſteemed ſo; and ſo binde him up in many things from walking by the <hi>Rules of Expediency.</hi> 4. Every Magiſtrate that calls himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> muſt be allowed the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's power,</hi> though never ſo <hi>prophane, erroneous,</hi> or <hi>heretical:</hi> for who dare controul him ſo far as to ſay he is <hi>no Chriſtian?</hi> or to wreſt the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Sword</hi> in this kind out of his hands, if it belong to him <hi>quâ Chriſtian?</hi> Or how dare any to ſay, he is <hi>not a Chriſtian</hi> ſo and ſo qualified, and therefore hath not ſuch a power? Neither is it fit any exception ſhould be taken in this manner; for we know nothing lies more open to cenſure than Magiſtrates Religion: and if every <hi>Subjects humour</hi> muſt be a Standard to the <hi>Magiſtrates Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> all things would fall as certainly to confuſion on that ſide. If you allow ſuch a power to him <hi>as Chriſtian,</hi> ſo he profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo he takes it; and it's too late to diſpute with him about
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:135610:53"/>his <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Qualifications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> under that denomination he took the Sword by your allowance, and hath now more wit than to part with it upon every humourſome exception made againſt the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or modality of his Chriſtianity. 5. If as <hi>a Chriſtian,</hi> then ſuch a power is a proper adjunct of a Chriſtian, and every Chriſtian ſhould have it; but nothing is more falſe and abſurd than this.</p>
            <p>§ 4. <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. That which deſtroys <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in the Church, ought not to be allowed; but for the Magiſtrate to exerciſe ſuch a Legiſlative power, deſtroys Uniformity in the Church, <hi>Ergo</hi> not to be allowed. The Major will be granted by our <hi>Contenders for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in Ceremonies. The Minor</hi> is evinced thus: it certainly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and deſtroys <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in the Catholick Church;</hi> and that which deſtroys Uniformity <hi>in a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> is the moſt univerſal enemy to it: for if every Supream Legiſlator in each Nation may dreſs up the National Church in a ſuit of Ceremonies ſhred out of Indifferencies, according to the imaginations of his own brain, (in which Ceremonies the great Uniformity contended for, doth conſiſt) there can never be an <hi>univerſal concord</hi> of all Nations, of the Engliſh, Greeks, Romaniſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to perfect and compleat the moſt beautiful and <hi>neceſſary <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity:</hi> All other ceremonial Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity which men undertake to plead for, is but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, Diſunion, Diſagreement,</hi> if not Schiſm it ſelf: for though it be <hi>National,</hi> yet if it be not <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> it's but a <hi>particular Church</hi> in a way of ſeparation from other Churches; as an Independent Congregation in a Pariſh that is Uniform within it ſelf in <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice,</hi> but diſunited and ſeparated from the Pariſh and <hi>all other ſorts of Churches</hi> whatſoever. Now if the <hi>ſtreſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> lie here (as theſe men plead) it cannot ſtand upon this baſis of the <hi>magiſtrates power:</hi> for there will never be the <hi>ſameneſs of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> in all places; Rulers being ſo adverſe to each other, that they glory rather in a contrariety of Laws and Cuſtoms, than are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of having the ſame. And let it be conſidered, whether the giving this power to him, doth not cut the very <hi>Throat of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the Catholick Church,</hi> and lay the very Seed-plot of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Diviſion.</hi> Hence thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> that lay the undoubted ground of Uniformity <hi>in a univerſal Head Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> do go upon far ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer grounds of Reaſon for the effecting it, than thoſe that pretend and deſigne to effect it by the <hi>Magiſtrates power,</hi> as we have ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>§ 5. <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. He that may not aſſume to himſelf the <hi>Executive
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135610:54"/>power</hi> of Eccleſiaſtical Laws, cannot <hi>enact Laws</hi> of the ſame kind. But the Civil Magiſtrate may not aſſume to himſelf an Executive power, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> The Major is evident, becauſe he that maketh Laws, may undertake alſo the <hi>Executive part,</hi> or diſpoſe of it by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</hi> And the Argument of the Major is from <hi>the leſs to the greater;</hi> for the <hi>Executive power</hi> is primitively in the Law-maker, and cannot become anothers but by <hi>derivation</hi> from him. <hi>Minor:</hi> but the Civil Magiſtrate hath no ſuch power conveyed to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mean, <hi>Judicial Eccleſiaſtical Execution,</hi> according to the true intent of the Law for Chriſt's inſtituted Worſhip. It is true; ſo far as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> is to be maintained in Religion and in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as well as Families, and other Societies therein, they are as liable to the <hi>Judicial proceedings</hi> of Magiſtrates, as any others be; but in theſe <hi>Evangelical parts of Worſhip</hi> annexed by Chriſt in ſubſtance or ceremony, which diſtinguiſheth the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> from that of the <hi>Commonweal,</hi> here the Magiſtrate cannot <hi>execute by himſelf,</hi> or <hi>depute another</hi> to adminiſter the <hi>Executive part</hi> of Chriſt's Laws. The reaſon is, becauſe all ſuch Laws changing Indifferencies into Neceſſities in the Worſhip of God, are of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> nature, and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and therefore muſt be <hi>executed ſpiritually</hi> in <hi>foro conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtically</hi> in <hi>foro Eccleſiae;</hi> but he cannot do either of theſe: for the firſt he cannot, becauſe Chriſt hath <hi>abſolutely</hi> reſerved Conſcience to himſelf; nor the latter, becauſe <hi>Execution</hi> in the Church is peculiar to the <hi>Officers of Chriſt,</hi> as his <hi>Deputies and Officers</hi> of his own appointment.</p>
            <p>§ 6. <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. They that are not to make Laws for the <hi>terrour</hi> of them that do well, are not to make ſuch Laws as change Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Indifferencies into Neceſſities; <hi>at. Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Minor is undeniable.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> appears thus to be true, becauſe to make ſuch Laws, is to <hi>terrifie Chriſtians</hi> in the uſe not onely of their <hi>lawful liberty,</hi> but alſo to ſhake them from their ſtanding in that liberty that Chriſt hath <hi>purchaſed, and commanded them to ſtand faſt in;</hi> beſides the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging them the free uſe of Chriſtian diſcretion, which is good, from which they ſhould not be terrified.</p>
            <p>§ 7. <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. The Magiſtrate cannot take away the <hi>Rights and Priviledges</hi> granted to the Church by Jeſus Chriſt, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by <hi>laſt Will and Teſtament</hi> beſtowed, and is his peoples right of Inheritance: But the liberty of the uſe of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcretion in matters of Indifferency, is <hi>a great and valuable priviledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſo granted and beſtowed on his Church and People.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:135610:54"/>Now the Magiſtrate ſhould be ſo far from bereaving the Church of theſe, that 1. He is to maintain and defend the Church in the free uſe of its <hi>Liberties,</hi> and to be as a Nurſing Father to her therein. 2. The Magiſtrate ſhould be ready to puniſh the <hi>bereaving</hi> of the Church of her juſt Rights, as <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> which is robbing a Church, a Sacred Body <hi>politick under</hi> the Civil Magiſtrates juriſdiction: The Magiſtrate ſhould be far from doing that action which he is to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in another as Sacriledge; and if a Chriſtian's Liberty be <hi>a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred thing,</hi> the taking of it away is <hi>Sacriledge.</hi> That it is Sacred, I prove thus: That which is of <hi>ſacred uſe,</hi> and <hi>peculiarly related to the Worſhip of God,</hi> and to the Members and Church of Chriſt, as <hi>their Priviledge,</hi> allotted to them by Chriſt's ſpecial procurement and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, is <hi>Sacred;</hi> and the taking it away is no better than <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge.</hi> As for other lawful Liberties (common to them with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Morals</hi> and <hi>Civils</hi>) others may uſe them that are not rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Goſpel; but a Chriſtian Liberty is in things <hi>pertaining unto Chriſt,</hi> and his ways of Worſhip and Service.</p>
            <p>§ 8. <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. He that can make thoſe things <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt, which Chriſt hath onely made indifferent, can make the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> to conſiſt in thoſe things that he never did: the <hi>Kingdom of God ſtands not in meats,</hi> &amp;c. and the Kingdom of God ſtands in that which is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to it; and if the Magiſtrate will make things <hi>neceſſary</hi> which Chriſt never did, he goes about to make the Kingdom of God <hi>ſtand in that</hi> which Chriſt never did. And this is a great uſurpation of a power not belonging unto him; for Chriſt never empowered the Magiſtrate to determine what his Kingdom ſhould conſiſt in, and make it to conſiſt in that which he never did.</p>
            <p>§ 9. <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. A Magiſtrate is not capable of exerciſing ſuch a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive power</hi> as will make me believe in my conſcience, that to be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> for the Worſhip of Chriſt, which I am convinced that he hath <hi>left indifferent</hi> onely; that Law for the Worſhip of Chriſt that lays no obligation on Conſcience, is of no concern therein. Now Chriſt having bound Conſcience by his Law as far as is neceſſary, there is no room left for Man to come in with his Laws. Whatever is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelically neceſſary to the Conſcience of a Chriſtian, is ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is convinced it is the <hi>Will of Chriſt</hi> that it ſhould be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now can the mere <hi>Coercive power</hi> of any one on Earth make a man believe that is not neceſſary which Chriſt hath made <hi>Conſcience to ſubmit</hi> to as neceſſary? If ſo, then may the ſame authority make
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:135610:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>a man believe that to be <hi>neceſſary</hi> which Chriſt hath made us believe not to be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but onely indifferent: for as no Law of man can abſolve a Chriſtian from the <hi>conſcientious obſervation</hi> of any one Law of Chriſt; ſo no Law of Man can binde a Chriſtian in Conſcience to the practice of that in religious matters, which Chriſt never bound him to; but he will be ſtill perſwaded that Chriſt hath left it to him as an indifferency, and it's his duty to walk in it by diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that muſt be a Churches or Chriſtian's own, as the matter requires, relating to a Community or private Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the <hi>Magiſtrates Judgment</hi> can beſt determine of <hi>Expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> being greateſt and wiſeſt. <hi>Anſ.</hi> In matters of that nature men may adviſe; and the greater and wiſer men are, its likely the more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments they may produce; but there is no force to be in the caſe, men are not to be forced by a Law to do that, which is moſt expedient in the Worſhip of God: For 1. the Magiſtrate may be miſtaken, and that which is expedient to him, may not be to another. 2. That which is expedient one time, may not be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore in the doing Expediencies, we are not to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to act always one way by a Law. <hi>Object.</hi> But the Magiſtrate may puniſh for not practiſing. <hi>Anſw.</hi> None is to be puniſhed for not practiſing what they believe unlawful.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Magiſtrates Sword, in the Execution of Eccleſtaſtical Juſtice.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. THe Second Enquiry propounded about the Magiſtrates pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is this; <hi>Whether in the Execution of Eccleſiaſtical Juſtice, the Sword of the Civil Magiſtrate may, or ought to be uſed? i. e.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the puniſhing and reforming Offendors againſt Church-Laws, the Magiſtrate may inflict ſuch penalties on the outward Man, as he and the Church ſhall agree upon; as Pecuniary Mulcts, Scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Impriſonments, Confiſcations, yea, death it ſelf in ſome caſes, as in matters of Hereſie and Seduction. And to prevent miſtakes, we ſhall premiſe theſe things: 1. That Church-Members offending <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws,</hi> may, and ought to ſuffer the penalties thereof from the hands of Magiſtrates, as ſuch as ſtand ſubjected to them in a civil ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, equal with other Subjects. 2. That a <hi>Church-Member</hi> (as of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:135610:55"/>the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any other) may juſtly ſuffer for the ſame Offence, <hi>from the Church, and Civil Magiſtrate;</hi> as for Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Fornication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moral Tranſgreſſions falling under the cognizance of both States, though under divers reſpects; but a Man is not <hi>ea ratione</hi> to be puniſhed by the Magiſtrate, becauſe cenſured by the Church, nor <hi>vice verſa.</hi> 3. Hence we aſſert, That the <hi>Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> cannot puniſh any <hi>Eccleſiaſtically, virtute Officii;</hi> neither doth any one meerly upon that account deſerve a puniſhment <hi>from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,</hi> becauſe he is apprehended to remain under <hi>a Church-cenſure;</hi> neither can the Church Appoint or Depute the Magiſtrate to uſe his <hi>Coercive power</hi> to reduce any one to Eccleſiaſtical obedience.</p>
            <p>§ 2. <hi>The Queſtion (on ſuppoſition that</hi> the Church will preſume to take on her the enacting and executing more Laws than ever Chriſt did or impowred her to do) hath two parts: 1. <hi>That in execution of Eccleſiaſtical Juſtice, of Chriſt's own Inſtitution, it is not agreeable to Chriſt's mind and will, that ſhe ſhould uſe the Magiſtrates Sword.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Church is not to uſe it</hi> in requiring her own Laws. I prove the firſt as follows.</p>
            <p>§ 3. <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Chriſt hath not annexed any <hi>Corporal puniſhments,</hi> or <hi>Pecuniary Mulcts</hi> to his Laws, which he hath enacted for the due governance of his Church; if he hath, let the Aſſerters ſhew where our Saviours Law is, <hi>If thy Brother offend, tell of it privately; if he hear not thee, take two or three more and admoniſh him; if he bear not them, tell the Church; if he bear not the Church, let him be as a Heathen and as a Publican unto thee;</hi> i. e. in reſpect of Chriſtian Communion and Society: and this is called by the Apoſtle, the <hi>delivering up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satan;</hi> there being but two ſorts of Communions in the world in this fence, in the Church, and out; <hi>in the Church</hi> is in Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; <hi>out of the Church,</hi> is Satans; and when he is caſt out of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Society of the Saints, it's for the <hi>humbling of him,</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to godly ſorrow and Repentance; which is called there by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>the deſtruction of the fleſh.</hi> But here is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of puniſhment, this being the higheſt the Church is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of executing: he ſays not, If he comes not in and ſubmits in ſo many days, let the Paſtor <hi>certifie</hi> to the Secular Powers, and let them ſeize his Body and Impriſon it, or his Eſtate and Confiſcate it: This is a new way of bringing Men into Goſpel-Repentance for Church-Offences, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles never practiſed or preſcribed. Will the Aſſertors ſay, that the meaning of delivery of an Offender to Satan, is the delivery of him to the Magiſtrate to be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:135610:56"/>puniſhed? this were to caſt a great odium on <hi>Civil Government,</hi> as if the Spirit of God did there repreſent the Magiſtrate under ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible a Character. 2. It were to conclude, that Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were not under the Magiſtrates power, to puniſh them for any Offences, till they were delivered up by the Church thereunto; and therefore, that he cannot take <hi>immediate cognizance</hi> of his Subjects Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; ſo fat as concerns Moral or Civil Juſtice, but muſt proceed ſtill according to the <hi>Churches appointment</hi> and determination. 3. That the Church hath a <hi>binding or looſing</hi> hand on the Magiſtrates Sword, to draw it out or put it up at her pleaſure and the Magiſtrate ſhould be Armor-bearer to the Church.</p>
            <p>§ 4. If Chriſt had annexed any ſuch penalties to his Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws, he had left his Church very <hi>lame in its Polity;</hi> for in moſt Ages it hath been Hated, Perſecuted, and Maligned, by Civil Powers under whom it hath Militated, and the point of the Magiſtrates Sword hath been turned againſt her, and not the Hilt put into her hand: now in ſuch a ſtate, how ſhould the poor Church obtain the ſaid Sword to cut off a <hi>periſhing Member?</hi> and how ſhould ſhe be able to execute any Cenſure effectually, according to Chriſt's Law, if there be ſuch a penalty annexed which no Church of Chriſt in ſome Ages hath been in the leaſt capacity of executing? If the Church were in capacity of doing it, it muſt be capacitated <hi>from within, or from without;</hi> if from within, then Chriſt hath empowered it with a <hi>Magiſtratical authority,</hi> and every Church, as ſuch, may uſe it: and if ſo, ſhe muſt ſhew <hi>Chriſt's Commiſſion</hi> for it. And if ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, it's a queſtion whether Civil States will allow it; ſhe had need have good power and ſtrength to maintain it, as the <hi>Pope</hi> hath. And where the challenge of ſuch Right hath been made, hath it not always been the occaſion of the greateſt Civil Broils in Kingdoms and States through Chriſtendom? And if it ſhould be made under Heathen States, and ſuch Churches ſhould preſume to inflict corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Puniſhments, or pecuniary Mulcts on offending Brethren, they muſt certainly expect the loſs of any Liberties they do enjoy, and be adjudged for Sedition, Treaſon, and Uſurpation. But if it be ſaid, that it's not from any <hi>Intrinſick power</hi> that the Church uſeth this Sword, then it will follow, that it belongs not to the Church as ſuch, neither is her inſeparable propriety. 2. She muſt onely borrow it; and ſuppoſe it will not be lent, doth the true execution of Chriſt's Laws fall to ground? and cannot Eccleſiaſtical Juſtice be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted? 3. Again, if we muſt borrow the Magiſtrates Sword upon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:135610:56"/>all <hi>occaſions of Reformation,</hi> then ſhe is not ſufficiently empowered by Chriſt <hi>to reform</hi> her ſelf; and <hi>Ergo,</hi> left more imperfect than any State or Society in the world; as civil Corporations and Families, yea, and particular Perſons, they have <hi>power intrinſick ſufficient</hi> for Self-reformation, if Vertue prevail, and the greater ruling part be not corrupt. The Sword of the Magiſtrate is no more Eſſential to the <hi>being or reforming a Church,</hi> than of a Family; a man may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a child, or turn away a ſervant, without a Magiſtrates power, or offending it, ſo he keep within the ſphere of Domeſtick Juſtice: So may a Church inflict the greateſt Eccleſiaſtical puniſhments without the Magiſtrate, or without intrenching upon him, ſo as the true bounds of Eccleſiaſtical Juſtice which Chriſt hath ſet, be obſerved. And this brings me to the ſecond Argument.</p>
            <p>§ 5. <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If the Church may and ought to inflict Eccleſiaſtical puniſtments to the full ſatisfaction of the Laws of Chriſt, without the <hi>uſe of the Sword of the Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> then they may not uſe the ſaid Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay, it's the higheſt Injuſtice to uſe it, it being ſeverity beyond <hi>Summum jus.</hi> But the Church may inflict puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the full ſatisfaction of Chriſt's Laws; Chriſt hath put an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Sword</hi> into the hands of the Church, to be managed againſt Offenders (diſtinct from the <hi>Civil Sword,</hi>) the juſt manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof is as much as he requires from the Church, and the undergoing the pains whereof, is as much as he requires that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Offenders ſhould ſuſtain in a Church-way. Neither doth the political Laws of his Church demand any ſuch ſatisfaction from Church-offenders, as <hi>Fines, Whippings, Impriſonment,</hi> though the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be ſuch, as under the cognizance of the civil Magiſtrate, by his Laws, and in his State, are deſervedly puniſhed ſo: As if a Church-member be drunk, the Magiſtrate may take him up in the ſtreet and ſet him by the heels; but if the Paſtor of the Church ſee him ſo, he hath no ſuch power as to puniſh his <hi>outward man,</hi> but to adminiſter <hi>Admonition, or Excommunication,</hi> as the matter requires, till the perſon offending is brought to true godly Remorſe and Reformation; but the Church hath nothing to do to impriſon him, put him in the Stocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or deliver him to the Magiſtrate by their Sentence ſo to be dealt with.</p>
            <p>§ 6. <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If the Church can and ought to uſe the <hi>Sword of the Magiſtrate,</hi> it's ſurely to correct for the moſt groſs and criminal Tranſgreſſions; as for <hi>Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Lying-Theft, Fornication, &amp;c.</hi> for all juſt Laws inflict the moſt Exemplary Puniſhments on the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:135610:57"/>moſt hainous and ſcandalous Offenders. But it's moſt evident the Church cannot uſe the Sword of the Magiſtrate, in caſe of the moſt criminal and hainous Tranſgreſſion; becauſe, 1. Chriſt nowhere em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers a Church, or ſo much as allows it, as ſuch, to <hi>fine, impriſon, hang,</hi> &amp;c. for offences deſerving the ſame at the hands of the civil Magiſtrate. 2. He nowhere requires the Churches to become <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> unto civil Magiſtrates; it belongs to the Magiſtrate to look after the obſervation of his own Laws; the Church is not to be his <hi>Conſtable</hi> to ſeize Offenders for him, neither is the State to be the Churches <hi>Hangman</hi> to execute for her; each State is to look after the execution of their own Laws, in their own way and manuer. 3. Where <hi>Paul</hi> is diſtinct in each particular of the cenſure to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon the <hi>inceſtuous perſon,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. requiring them to execute it in a ſtrict and ſharp manner in the <hi>Name and Power of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> and although Inceſt is a crime to be <hi>puniſhed by the Judge,</hi> and with death by the Law of God, he writes not to the Church to inflict any corporal puniſhment on him; neither doth he certifie the civil Magiſtrate againſt him, or command the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to <hi>inform.</hi> What <hi>Peter</hi> did in the caſe of <hi>Ananias,</hi> was extraordinary and miraculous, and not preſidential in the leaſt to any ſucceeding Church-Officers; neither did he aſſume any civil Authority in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Neither doth the National Church (notwithſtanding all her ſeverity <hi>uſed towards Non-conformiſts</hi>) execute any ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the like ſort of groſs Offenders, or by the higheſt cenſures turn them over to <hi>Civil Powers</hi> for that end, though ſhe ſaith that all men and women inhabiting within her Precincts, at leaſt all ſuch as are chriſtened, are actually Church-members; and although it's a confeſſed Principle of all Proteſtants, that all openly ſcandalous Church-members incorrigible, ought by cenſure to be cut off from Communion; and although her ſelf affirms that the ultimate means to be uſed in caſes of obſtinacy, perſiſted in (which ſhe calls Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt) after Church-cenſures, is the application of the Magiſtrates <hi>Coercive power.</hi> Now how well ſhe doth apply theſe Church-Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the ſcandalous Church-members, let the impartial judge. Is it not requiſite that ſhe ſhould wait upon all her Tyburn and Goal-bird Sons and Daughters a little more than ſhe doth? and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour firſt by Admonition to bring them to Remorſe; and in caſe of obſtinacy to excommunicate them, and not ſuffer obſtinate Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons and Traitors to be hang'd within the Pale of the Church?
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:135610:57"/>Indeed there needs no certifying to the Magiſtrate, and taking them by a Writ <hi>de Excom. cap.</hi> becauſe the Magiſtrate hath ſecured them already: but I will tell you where there is need, <hi>viz.</hi> for the picking up of obſtinate contumacious Drunkards, Swearers, and fornicating Church-members, which the Land ſwarms with. And what a bleſſed Reformation would there be, if <hi>Mother-Church</hi> did do her duty in this kinde ſo ſtrictly as ſhe deals with Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts! <hi>viz.</hi> in admoniſhing them; and in caſe of contumacy, to excommunicate them; and upon their perſeverance in the ſaid ſins, to take them all up with Writs <hi>de Excom. cap.</hi> and ſend them to Priſon, there to abide till they repent. If the Church proceeded thus with the generality of ſcandalous and looſe Pariſh-members, the major part left at liberty would be Non-conformiſts; and if they were ſecured too for Non-conformity, the old Woman might know where to finde moſt of her children of <hi>both adventures.</hi> But who is ſo blinde as not to ſee the <hi>unſpeakable Partiality</hi> of the Church in this kind, in crying out againſt the conſcientious Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and perſecuting of them in ſo mercileſs and outrageous a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in letting all the reſt of the ranting debauched Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers go Scot-free, yea, and encouraging them to perſecute the reſt more ſerious and conſcientious, under the name of Separatiſts and Schiſmaticks? <hi>Dat veniam corvis, vexat cenſura columbas.</hi> Juven.</p>
            <p>§ 8. The ſecond part of the Queſtion about the <hi>uſe of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Sword in execution of Eccleſiaſtical Juſtice,</hi> is built upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the Church might make Laws, beſides what Chriſt hath made, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuppoſing ſhe might change Indifferencies into Neceſſities by poſitive Laws. The Queſtion is, <hi>Whether it be agreeable to her Juſtice and Wiſdom, to annex to her Laws the ſaid corporal or pecuniary Puniſhments,</hi> or cauſe the Magiſtrate ſo to do? We anſwer in the <hi>Negative,</hi> for theſe reaſons. 1. Becauſe to annex or cauſe to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed the ſevereſt puniſhments, or at leaſt moſt ſmarting to Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Laws of leaſt concernment to the Publick weal of Church and State, and of the leaſt neceſſity in reſpect of the Obſervers, is neither <hi>Juſtice</hi> nor <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> but for the Church to annex Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or cauſe to be annexed corporal Puniſhments, or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary Mulcts, to Laws of her own making, in matters of Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is to put the <hi>ſevereſt Penalties</hi> to Laws of <hi>leaſt concernment. The Major</hi> is moſt evident, becauſe <hi>Wiſdom and Juſtice</hi> always requires that there be a due proportion between the weight of Obedience required, and the Puniſhment of the Diſobedience forbidden. The
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:135610:58"/>
               <hi>Minor</hi> is granted by the Impoſers and Compoſers of Eccleſiaſtical Laws of this kind, and (as they think) a plauſible defence of themſelves in ſo doing, <hi>viz.</hi> that they exerciſe this <hi>Legiſlation</hi> onely in matters of ſmaller concern, <hi>not neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> left by Chriſt indifferent; and what neceſſary goodneſs they pretend to be in them, is the ſhewing our obedience to our Superiours, and ſatisfying the Will of man, and ſome little external Decency and ſuperficial Uniformity: And for offending in this kind, her children m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt be ſtript of Priviledges, and laid open to all injuries of Church and State. Doth this conſiſt of Chriſtian Prudence and Juſtice? Is it not <hi>to tythe Mint and Annice</hi> with the greateſt zeal, and not onely to neglect the weighty Laws, but to encourage the violation of them, by taking into her boſome and dandling on her knee the moſt auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Tranſgreſſors, and the greateſt and moſt profeſſed Enemies not onely to the <hi>power of Godlineſs,</hi> but to <hi>common Honeſty and Morality?</hi> 2. If it had been Political Wiſdom or Juſtice to annex ſuch Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Eccleſiaſtical Laws of any kind, ſure Chriſt (in whom are all the <hi>Treaſures of Wiſdom</hi>) would not have been wanting in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing Penalties of that kind to his own Laws of the greateſt and weightieſt concern to his Church. 3. We judge of the greatneſs and weighty concern of any Law, uſually by the greatneſs of the <hi>Penalty</hi> annexed, in caſe of tranſgreſſion: and therefore herein we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that the Churches own Laws challengeth a preheminency before the Laws of Chriſt's own compoſure; and would this King of kings make onely Laws of leſſer concern, and ſubſtitute others to make the greater? this is abſurd to believe. 4. It is a great piece of pride in <hi>Mother-Church</hi> to advance her ſelf ſo far above the <hi>Civil State,</hi> that the Magiſtrate ſhould become the Executioner of her Laws; for the <hi>Law-maker</hi> hath always a great priority and dignity above the <hi>Executioner.</hi> If it be replied, That the Church onely craves the Magiſtrates aſſiſtance to compleat her Eccleſiaſtical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and make them ſtick cloſer on upon the backs of Offenders, <hi>Anſw.</hi> Herein the Church bewrays her own weakneſs, in that ſhe confeſſeth ſhe is not a <hi>compleat Polity,</hi> neither hath power enough to reform her ſelf, or effectually enough to execute her own Laws, without being beholding to an <hi>Exotick power:</hi> As if a <hi>Maſter of a Family</hi> had not power enough to execute Domeſtick Laws in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a <hi>Child</hi> or <hi>Servant,</hi> without asking his neighbours leave, and calling for his aſſiſtance. But in caſe the Church ſaith, (as indeed ſhe doth) that ſhe goeth to the civil Magiſtrate by way of Appeal,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:135610:58"/>and the ſaid Magiſtrate hath power at his pleaſure to ſuperſede her proceedings; This is to ſet the State above the Church in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks; whereas the civil State is <hi>Subordinate to the Eccleſiaſtick</hi> ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtically, and the Eccleſiaſtical to the Civil civilly; and both in reſpect of the exerciſe of Juriſdiction in each particular Orb parallel or <hi>co-ordinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 9. Laſtly, ſuch <hi>Penalties</hi> that cannot anſwer the natural end and deſigne of Church-cenſures, may not be annexed or uſed by the Church; but ſuch a Penalty anſwers not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted; the <hi>Minor</hi> thus appears: 1. Becauſe the Sword of the Magiſtrate reacheth but the outward man; whereas the end of Church-cenſures is to reach the Conſcience. 2. The natural uſe of Church-cenſures, is the exerciſe of them in <hi>foro Eccleſiae;</hi> but the <hi>Coercive power</hi> of the Magiſtrate may not be exerciſed in <hi>foro Eccleſiae,</hi> upon any allowable pretence whatſoever.</p>

            </head>
            <p>§ 1. THe third Enquiry propounded, is concerning <hi>the true bounds and limits of the Magiſtrates power in matters of Religion;</hi> a great and difficult Queſtion, but of very great concern to us that it be rightly reſolved. I do not expect to be ſo happy as to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers full ſatisfaction in it, I being not able to do it to my ſelf ſo far as I would; I ſhall onely go as far as I can, and is convenient for this undertaking, with all poſſible brevity and demonſtration.</p>
            <p>We ſpake before in the <hi>two former Queſtions</hi> concerning the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates power in matters of Indifferency, both Legiſlative and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive, on the behalf of the Church. This Queſtion is of larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent concerning his whole power <hi>in matters of Religion,</hi> and enquire how far he may and ought to go, and how far he may not go, <hi>i. e.</hi> he cannot go without Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>§ 2. <hi>Matters of Religion</hi> is a large word, and it comprehends not onely <hi>Religion it ſelf,</hi> but all <hi>circumſtances and attendances thereof;</hi> which are Indifferencies in themſelves, neither <hi>moraly good or evil;</hi> but in regard of their tendency and reſpect, they are ſo. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135610:59"/>the Magiſtrates Legiſlative power in theſe things, we have ſpoken ſomewhat already.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak no more here of the <hi>nature of Religion,</hi> than to make way for my preſent Undertaking. Religion is uſually underſtood to comprehend all <hi>moral Duties</hi> and all <hi>inſtituted Worſhip;</hi> to which if we adde the aforeſaid attending circumſtances, we uſe a larger way of expreſſion, and call them <hi>matters of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. The Moral Law is a <hi>general ſtanding Rule</hi> to all ſorts of Actions, Perſons, and Societies of the children of men, whereby God himſelf hath challenged the <hi>firſt right of dominion;</hi> as of particular men, ſo of all neceſſary Fabricks of Rule and Government in the world: So that all <hi>Actions, Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Societies,</hi> duely meaſured and ſquared thereby, are rightly called Religious, and the contrary Irreligious. Hence particular, <hi>Domeſtick, Eccleſiaſtick,</hi> and <hi>Civil Juriſdictions</hi> in a Chriſtian Commonwealth, are in proper ſence called all of them Religious.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Religion, taken in a ſtricter and more limited ſence, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a holy life and converſation of particular Perſons and Societies, not onely according to the general Rules of <hi>moral Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but according to the <hi>more, particular and ſpecial appointments and Goſpel-inſtitutions</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby he ſeparates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf the moſt <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>peculiar Societies</hi> in the world, under his proper and more immediate Rule and Government, which are called his Church.</p>
            <p>§ 5. Therefore, 1. The civil Chriſtian Magiſtrate hath no power (in the ſtrict ſence) in matters of Religion, <hi>quatenus Magiſtrate,</hi> no more than a Heathen hath: for though the <hi>embracing the Chriſtian Religion</hi> doth much <hi>capacitate</hi> the civil Magiſtrate, as to his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and endeavours for the improvement of his Magiſtratical power toward the advantage of Religion; yet it adds no new power or juriſdiction to him over Churches, Families, Chriſtians, or others: for a Heathen Magiſtrate is as much in his place the <hi>ſupream Head and Governmnour</hi> of the Church (conſidered in a civil capacity under his Government) as the moſt <hi>Faith-defending Chriſtian, or Catholick Prince</hi> in the world: Neither by his embracing Chriſtianity doth he attain any <hi>augmentation</hi> of his Magiſtratical Power, Headſhip, or Supremacy. A Chriſtian is no more bound, as a <hi>Subject,</hi> by the Rules of the Goſpel, to a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, than to a <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Heretical Magiſtrate.</hi> The Rules are indefinite to a Magiſtrate as ſuch, though a Chriſtian Subject will be the better man and Subject,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:135610:59"/>and a Chriſtian Magiſtrate the better man and Magiſtrate; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity making every one the <hi>better man,</hi> and <hi>better qualified</hi> for the performance of the <hi>relative Duty</hi> of his place that he is ſet in.</p>
            <p>§ 6. <hi>Secondly,</hi> No civil Magiſtrate can be an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Head and Governour</hi> of the Church, as ſuch: It's Chriſt's <hi>Prerogative</hi> to be the Supream, and to conſtitute what other Heads and Governours he in his wiſdom thinks beſt. But I finde not that he ever made any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate a conſtitutive Eccleſiaſtical Head or Governour to his Church <hi>virtute Officii:</hi> for if ſo, in every Chriſtian Dominion the Prince ſhould be the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> and the true Paſtor to that National Church.</p>
            <p>§ 7. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> No civil Magiſtrate can by virtue of any authority granted by Chriſt, challenge to himſelf a <hi>Legiſtative power</hi> in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matters touching <hi>Faith or Worſhip:</hi> he cannot <hi>null or diſpenſe</hi> with one of the Laws of Jeſus Chriſt; neither may he make any new Laws to binde us to believe any thing more concerning God, than is manifeſtly by his Word revealed; or binde us to practice any <hi>alteration or addition</hi> in the Worſhip of God, more than what Chriſt himſelf hath enacted. This we have ſufficiently proved in handling the Doctrine of Indifferency.</p>
            <p>§ 8. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> No civil Magiſtrate can by any <hi>deputation</hi> from Chriſt, claim an <hi>Executive power</hi> of the Political Laws of Chriſt in his Church: for as Chriſt hath his own proper Laws in his Church, his militant Kingdom, diſtinct from other Laws for the right and exact Goſpel-management of all his <hi>Political affairs</hi> therein, and is more faithful than <hi>Moſes</hi> in that very reſpect; ſo he hath ſet in his Church <hi>his own Miniſters and Officers,</hi> diſtinct from all other ſorts of Officers and Miniſters in the world: As Chriſt's Miniſters are no civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates as ſuch, ſo no civil Magiſtrate <hi>is a Church-Miniſter as ſuch.</hi> Hence, as a civil Magiſtrate hath no power to execute Chriſt's <hi>Political Laws</hi> or Inſtitutions in his Church; ſo he hath no power to execute any <hi>moral Laws</hi> in the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> he cannot puniſh a criminal offence by <hi>Eccleſiaſtical cenſures.</hi> The moral Law runs through <hi>all Societies,</hi> as the natural fundamental Rule to diſcern Good and Evil; and Political Laws of all ſorts ſhould mainly reſpect it as the <hi>Standard</hi> and <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of all Laws and Juſtice which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it are <hi>derivative;</hi> though every particular Polity hath its own proper way and manner of diſtribution of moral Juſtice; The civil State by a <hi>civil political Adminiſtration and Magiſtracy;</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies <hi>Oeconomically,</hi> by the Heads thereof; the Churches <hi>Eccleſiaſtically,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:135610:60"/>by its Paſtors and other Officers; all endeavouring by their diſtinct way and manner of Adminiſtration, to ſecure the honour and juſtice of the Moral Law: but none of theſe are to intermix their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and <hi>political way of diſtribution,</hi> ſeeing the God of Order hath fixed each one to his proper ſtation and limit of juriſdiction. Hence the civil State can no more puniſh the breach of moral Laws <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtically,</hi> than the Church can puniſh them <hi>civilly;</hi> and the Church can no more uſe the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> Sword, than the Magiſtrate can the <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>vice verſa;</hi> neither can the Church or civil State puniſh the breaches of the moral Law <hi>Oeconomically,</hi> any more than a Maſter of a Family, as ſuch, can puniſh them <hi>Eccleſiaſtically or Civilly,</hi> and upon that account may take upon him to be Magiſtrate or Paſtor. And though there was a mixture or rather conjunction of theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities in the ſame perſon, in the infancy of Polities, yet they have been ſeparated in diſtinct perſons by God himſelf for many Ages; neither do any perſons bearing diſtinct Offices, make the Offices the ſame, or neceſſarily mingle them in the performance of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Functions.</p>
            <p>§ 9. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is not in the power of the <hi>civil Magiſtrate</hi> or any humane Laws, to <hi>binde or looſe</hi> Conſcience. As Magiſtrates cannot reach it directly to charge it with either <hi>duty or guilt,</hi> ſo it's the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt piece of Tyranny to attempt it by <hi>Penal Laws;</hi> whereby Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may be drawn in, to enſnare their Conſciences in guilt, by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God for <hi>fear of Man,</hi> and a Chriſtian is to obey the juſt Laws of man <hi>for Conſcience ſake,</hi> i. e. for the <hi>Lords ſake.</hi> It is <hi>extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> to the Laws of men, to binde Conſcience; it's God that by his authority gives them a mediate <hi>Sanction,</hi> and binds them on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but where God lends not to humane Laws his <hi>binding power,</hi> they are of no more force unto Conſcience, than Withs to binde <hi>Sampſon.</hi> It's not the wit or ſtrength of all Men and Angels that can binde one Conſcience <hi>under guilt,</hi> without a Law of God, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority to give force to <hi>humane: their Penal Laws,</hi> i.e. corporal Puniſhments or pecuniary Mulcts, are very <hi>indirect and vain Mediums</hi> to enforce Conſcience, and very ſinfully applied by Magiſtrates or others for that end, in matters of Faith or Worſhip.</p>
            <p>§ 10. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the ſupream Magiſtrate hath not the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Cauſes meenly Eceleſiaſtical;</hi> and theſe are of two ſorts, either <hi>controverted Doctrinals, or Cauſes diſciplinary</hi> controverted: for by <hi>Cauſes</hi> are to be underſtood here, things under <hi>diſpute</hi> (and they controverted Doctrinals) or under <hi>debate</hi> (and they controverted
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:135610:60"/>Cauſes diſciplinary;) and thoſe Eccleſiaſtical things which are of this nature, fall under one of theſe heads, <hi>Doctrinal or Diſciplinary.</hi> Firſt, In <hi>doctrinal Cauſes controverted,</hi> the Magiſtrate is not appointed by Chriſt as <hi>Judge,</hi> neither is he a <hi>competent Judge.</hi> 1. If he be <hi>quatenus</hi> a Magiſtrate, then every Magiſtrate is a <hi>competent Judge,</hi> and then a Heathen, Mahometan, or Heretical Magiſtrate; and then you'll ſay the determination muſt needs be very ſound and good. 2. Again, how few Chriſtian Magiſtrates are ſtudied enough in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical Divinity</hi> (being not bred to that learning, or having ſo many recreations and ſecular concerns to divert them from it) ſo as to be fit to have the <hi>ultimate determination</hi> of the moſt difficult and weighty points, that learned Scholars in Divinity, yea, ſuch as are <hi>ſtudious and conſcientious Chriſtians, after long ſtudy, ſcrutiny, and prayer,</hi> cannot attain to a right underſtanding of, ſo as to demonſtrate the truth to the full and clear ſatisfaction of themſelves or others? Is it fit to make an Aſſembly of Divines, Judges of a great and difficult caſe in Law? There is the ſame reaſon for one as for the other. 3. What determination a Magiſtrate makes <hi>dogmatically,</hi> it's <hi>ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer</hi> but his private Judgment and Opinion, though he be a publick perſon: And why ſhould any mans <hi>private opinion</hi> (be he what he will in the world) be a binding Rule to the Faith of another in matters of Religion? 4. It's impoſſible that it ſhould be ſo; for man cannot make a Law to <hi>bound Faith</hi> in ſuch things as are not founded on the light of Underſtanding; and where they are ſo founded, no man believes becauſe of the Law of man, but becauſe of the <hi>evidence of Truth.</hi> What Law can make any man believe that two and three make ſix? but if it be, that we muſt believe that three and three make ſix, we do believe it; but not becauſe of the Penal Law, but becauſe of the <hi>evidence the Truth carries</hi> with it: <hi>Non lex penalis, ſed veritas eſt ratio formalis fidei.</hi> 5. The Faith of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> or the Underſtanding of a <hi>Rational man,</hi> can no more reſt in the opinion or determination of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, without a ſufficient light of Truth to convince him, than in the opinion and determination of another man: for he that tenders the honour of God, and loves Truth, cannot receive that which he is convinced of (or at leaſt ſuſpects in his moſt ſerious judgment) to be contrary to the truth of the Word of God. 6. The Magiſtrate cannot be conteded to be ſuch a Judge, nor is uſeful as ſuch, unleſs he may be acknowledged to be <hi>infallible.</hi> A ſupream Judge in our ſence, and that which muſt be here underſtood, is one into whoſe judgment our
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135610:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>Faith hath its laſt and utmoſt reſolution; but we cannot acquieſce in a <hi>humane fallible determination.</hi> And beſides, what Prerogative hath the Magiſtrates judgment above another mans? and what eaſe and advantage is it to us, if our minds lie open to doubt as much after as before the determination? No Chriſtians minde can reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in a <hi>humane fallible opinion</hi> of divine things; the authority cauſing Belief, muſt have the ſame original that the Revelation hath: therefore Faith built upon a Teſtimony, muſt be onely on his <hi>own fidelity</hi> as one infallible; as we believe that Truth alſo which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries its <hi>own Evidence</hi> with it axiomatically delivered, or evinceth it ſelf from the light of another Truth <hi>dianoetically.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 11. The ſecond Caſe conſiſts in <hi>Cauſes diſciplinarily</hi> debated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Differences ariſing within one particular Church, or between Church and Church, or between Paſtors and Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All <hi>Cauſes</hi> uſually handled and determined in Eccleſiaſtical Courts. The Queſtion is, Whether the civil Magiſtrate be the ſupream Judge, or Head and Governour? By Cauſes Eccleſiaſtick, are without doubt meant in the Oath of Supremacy, all <hi>diſciplinary Cauſes</hi> handled in Spiritual Courts, the ſupream Head and Governor whereof was the Pope; in whoſe name and authority thoſe Courts were called and managed, and to whom it was lawful for any grieved party to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> before the reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th; who by the Oath of Supremacy cut off the Popes Supremacy, and eſtabliſhed his own. Now I thus reſolve, as followeth.</p>
            <p>§ 12. If Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual Courts be not <hi>jure divino,</hi> nor held <hi>jure divino</hi> (Epiſcopacy as it's ſetled in the Hierarchy, and all its Offices and Appurtenances, being onely a <hi>humane politick device,</hi> as hath been abundantly by the Oppoſers thereof proved, and by many of the Aſſerter; and Defenders confeſſed;) then, I ſay, it's fitter that man ſhould be ſupream Head there; and if any man, the ſupream civil Magiſtrate, within whoſe Realm or Dominion their Courts and Cauſes <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> be. The nature of this Supremacy is or ſhould be, that 1. That all Eccleſiaſtical Courts be called and kept in the Kings Magiſties name. 2. That the Sentence denounced ſhould be alſo grounded on ſome penal Law of the King; for all the Kings Courts ſhould <hi>judge by his Laws.</hi> 3. That any party grieved may <hi>appeal</hi> to a ſuperiour Court of the Kings, or to himſelf, from whom there is <hi>no Appeal.</hi> 4. That the King hath power by himſelf or Judges, to <hi>prohibit</hi> or <hi>ſuperſede</hi> the proceedings of the ſaid Court at his pleaſure. This is the true ſence of the Oath of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135610:61"/>Supremacy, which the Biſhops, notwithſtanding all the noiſe they make againſt Diſſenters from their Church, will leaſt ſubſcribe unto; whereas moſt others of the Kings Subjects that refuſe to own the <hi>divine right</hi> of Epiſcopal government, will willingly ſwear the Kings Supremacy in their Eccleſiaſtical Courts and Cauſes in the largeſt extent. And though that ſort of ruling men uſe all endeavours to ſuggeſt the <hi>diſloyalty</hi> of the ſaid Diſſenters, yet I doubt not but moſt <hi>Puritans</hi> in <hi>England</hi> would rather refer themſelves to the Kings judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtand or fall at his Tribunal, than at the Churches; and have generally found more <hi>relief</hi> from under the ſeverities of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication in the <hi>Kings Courts,</hi> than in the Eccleſiaſtical. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that all Eccleſiaſtical proceedings in Spiritual Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, and the whole Fabrick of Church-government, as now it ſtands, is a <hi>humane Polity,</hi> as is not denied by the moſt ingenious, I know not why any <hi>Puritan</hi> or <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſhould refuſe for to take the Oath of Supremacy, for it is no more than to acknowledge the King to be ſupream Head and Governour in his own Courts; which is but <hi>Reaſon, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> that he ſhould be.</p>
            <p>§ 13. But if Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes be underſtood of <hi>diſciplinary Controverſies,</hi> ſuch as follow upon the execution of Laws, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Inſtitutions of the Lord Jeſus in the viſible Goſpel-churches; of ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes it is not the Magiſtrates part to be the <hi>determinating Judge</hi> of: for, 1. To judge and determine a Cauſe in the Church of Chriſt, is to <hi>judge Eccleſiaſtically;</hi> and ſuch an act of Judicature is <hi>a Church-act,</hi> which is always preceded by a <hi>Church-Officer,</hi> and no other, in <hi>foro Eccleſiae;</hi> and if the agrieved party appeal, it muſt be to an Officer of the <hi>ſame kind,</hi> it's not to an Officer of another State. 2. He that is ſupream Judge of a Church-cauſe on Earth, muſt be an <hi>Officer ſubſtituted by Chriſt;</hi> for none can hold any Place or Office in the Church, but by <hi>Subrogation</hi> from Chriſt, much leſs the higheſt Authority: but none can ſhew that Chriſt hath <hi>ſubſtituted</hi> the Magiſtrate his <hi>Church-Vicar</hi> on Earth. 3. If the civil Magiſtrate be ſupream Head to the Church <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> then, becauſe he was always ſo ſince Chriſt was on Earth, then there was times when Heathen Magiſtrates, in whoſe juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Churches was, were his <hi>Vicars:</hi> and Chriſt himſelf, when on Earth, was ſubject <hi>Eccleſiaſtically,</hi> though Head of his Church, to <hi>Heathen Church-Officers;</hi> for he was no civil Magiſtrate, diſclaim'd it, nor could be appeal'd unto as ſuch. 4. If the civil Magiſtrate be ſupream Judge, he is the <hi>ſupream Church-Officer;</hi> for he cannot be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135610:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>denied to be an Officer of that ſtate wherein he doth acts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature as his right: And if a Church-Officer, then the civil State hath power to chuſe and conſtitute a Church-Officer, and that of the higheſt rank; for if he become a Church-Officer, his Calling and Conſtitution muſt needs be Civil, and not Eccleſiaſtical: So that the civil State hath the power of <hi>Peter's Keys</hi> both to diſpoſe of them and give them to whom ſhe will, and the Church cannot be entruſted with them; they muſt ſtill be kept in the <hi>Magiſtrates pocket.</hi> Hence it will follow, that Chriſt hath not left power enough in the Church for the management of <hi>its own political affairs,</hi> nor wiſdom enough for the determining <hi>her own Controverſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 14. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> No civil Magiſtrate can <hi>impoſſe Articles of Faith</hi> on any of his Subjects, to be owned, ſubſcribed, or ſworn to by a Penal Law: for <hi>quatenus a Magiſtrate</hi> he is not an univerſal compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge; for it's not neceſſary that he ſhould be religious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, found in his principles, becauſe he is a Magiſtrate. 1. If he can do it as a <hi>Church-Officer,</hi> we have ſhewed that Chriſt hath made no ſuch Officers in his Church. 2. If he were, Chriſt never empowered any Church-Officer to uſe a <hi>Magiſtratical Sword;</hi> he never put Temporal Crowns on their heads, nor Scepters into their hands: if any of them, out of ambition, have <hi>got Miters and Croſier Staffs,</hi> they had them from Antichriſt, and not from Chriſt. 3. He never ordained that force of Arms and Penal Laws ſhould be the way of propagating <hi>his Faith.</hi> 4. <hi>Forced Faith</hi> is neither plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Chriſt, nor profitable to us; for indeed it's no Faith at all. A force may lay hold of the Outward man, but it cannot make the Underſtanding to believe that which it ſees no reaſon for to believe, no more than the Senſes in the natural ſtate can be forced to own things to be contrary <hi>Objects;</hi> as the Eye to own white to be black, the Taſte to own that for ſweet which is bitter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 15. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> No civil Magiſtrate can impoſe <hi>a form of the Worſhip</hi> of God by a Penal Law. 1. Becauſe he cannot receive into the Church nor caſt out of it at his pleaſure. 2. If he could, then the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <hi>form of Worſhip</hi> muſt be ſuch as the Magiſtrates; for if it be juſtifiable in one Magiſtrate to enforce his Subjects to a <hi>form of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip,</hi> becauſe he thinks it beſt, then it's juſtifiable in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: If the Epiſcopal Magiſtrate may <hi>jure</hi> enforce his <hi>form of divine Worſhip,</hi> then the <hi>Popiſh Magiſtrate</hi> may enforce his form, and the <hi>Presbyterian Magiſtrate</hi> his form, and an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> his form, and every form muſt become lawful and neceſſary to be practiſed, becauſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:135610:62"/>the civil Magiſtrate commands it: for we muſt not ſuppoſe any one Magiſtrate, as ſuch, to be more <hi>infallible</hi> than another; and ſo upon every change of the ſupream Magiſtrate of a differing Perſwaſion, the <hi>Peace and Conſciences</hi> of the moſt religious people muſt be wrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and torn in pieces. Again, it's the moſt irrational thing in the world to force a man to ſerve his God in ſuch a way as he <hi>conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly</hi> judgeth or ſuppoſeth to be diſpleaſing unto him. Likewiſe if the form of Worſhip impoſed by the Magiſtrate be pleaſing to Chriſt, his impoſition cannot, becauſe there cannot be a readier way to the prophanation of the holieſt things, than to force them to come to them that are not onely wicked and prophane in their lives, and corrupt in their hearts, but ſuch as are profeſſed Enemies unto them, and would have nothing to do with them, but to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ſmart of Penal Laws; and the beſt of ſuch perſons that make a more plauſible compliance, can be no Better than Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, that the Law being removed, their Religion would be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>§ 16. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> As the civil Magiſtrate cannot enforce his Subjects to <hi>Particular forms</hi> of real or ſuppoſed inſtituted Worſhip, ſo he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enforce them to <hi>poſitive acts of moral divine Worſhip.</hi> As 1. We finde no Precept or Example for forcing a poor Pagan to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God; and for whipping, impriſoning, or any other way afflicting his carcaſe by a Penal Law, becauſe of his not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the true God. To puniſh a poor Jew till he would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſt and worſhip him, would ſeem hard. 2. And among ſuch as do own the true God, the Magiſtrate cannot, puniſh <hi>omiſſions</hi> or <hi>refuſals</hi> of acts of poſitive Worſhip. As for inſtance in Prayer, the Magiſtrate cannot enforce a man to pray to his God, and puniſh him for not doing it. Theſe are things, though ſins, and that of the higheſt rank, yet ſuch as God intended the Sword of <hi>civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> ſhould never reach. There is in every Command of God a <hi>prohibiting and preſcribing part:</hi> The ſins againſt the prohibiting part, is the doing ſome act forbidden by the <hi>Moral Law;</hi> and here uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the place for the <hi>execution of a Penalty</hi> by the hands of humane Juſtice. Puniſhable ſins by man are commonly acts of <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and ſuch acts muſt be <hi>apparent,</hi> not ſecret, brought before the Judge <hi>per allegata &amp; probata;</hi> and they are uſually <hi>criminal</hi> direct breaches, not <hi>conſequential,</hi> dubious, and ſmall. I know there lies an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt this; which is, That a Father may correct a childe for not doing his command; and ſo a Maſter a ſervant. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:135610:63"/>granted, and ſo will God puniſh the children of men for all omiſſions <hi>of their duty: He that knew his maſters will and did it not, ſhould be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> Then there is a great difference between the conſtitution of a State-government and of a Family-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In a Family a Father, being a natural Relation, hath (ſo far as his power goes) a more Arbitrary way for the management of it, as he can correct his childe upon his mere ſuſpicions of evil in him, or refuſal of good, without poſitive proof; ſo for omiſſions in not doing his duty; and ſo for ſervants: the reaſon is, becauſe it's ſuppoſed children and ſervants are under tutorage as well as bare government, and therefore muſt be kept up to poſitive acts of duty, being under education of Parents and Maſters. But it's not ſo with Subjects; they are ſubjected to a Magiſtrate for another end, <hi>viz.</hi> in order to the maintaining the due execution of <hi>Commutative Juſtice,</hi> and in caſe of the failure thereof, <hi>of diſtributive;</hi> and all things are to be brought before the Magiſtrate by evidence, of matter of mere <hi>fact,</hi> and <hi>acceſſories</hi> thereunto. God hath not required that Laws ſhould be ſo <hi>diſtinct and expreſs</hi> in a Family, as in a State, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Family being for the moſt part <hi>diſcretionary:</hi> if an eye be had chiefly to the general Rules of God's Word, though Omiſſions of ſome kind come under the cognizance of the Magiſtrate, it's principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in caſes of commutative Juſtice, when ſuch Omiſſions are injurious to our Neighbours right; but thoſe are not reckoned criminals.</p>
            <p>§ 17. Having had ſome ſhort view of what we judge (upon good grounds) comes not under his <hi>inſpection</hi> as a Magiſtrate, we would conſider a little in the next place how <hi>far a Magiſtrate may go in uſing his Magiſtratick Sword in matters of Religion.</hi> We have ſhewed that matters of Religion, taken in a more limited ſence of Faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Worſhip in the Church of Chriſt, are not within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Magiſtrates Penal Laws. But if we underſtand matters of Religion in a larger ſence, then we mean that all States and Societies of men ought in a <hi>Chriſtian Commonwealth</hi> to be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Moral Rules of Juſtice ſhould be the <hi>foundation</hi> of all Juſtice adminiſtred in the <hi>Church, Civil State,</hi> and <hi>Family;</hi> and each of them ought to have a main reſpect to every branch of the Moral Law, and adjudge the breaches thereof to be ſin, and each Polity to puniſh it according to its merit, ſo far as is allowed by the Charter of Juriſdiction from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Exemp. gra.</hi> Suppoſe <hi>Theft be the ſin,</hi> the Parent can correct his child <hi>with the Rod,</hi> the Church puniſh him with <hi>a Cenſure,</hi> and the State by ſome <hi>Corporal
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:135610:63"/>Exemplary ſuffering.</hi> Though the Tranſgreſſion be the ſame, and juſtly puniſhable in all, yet the <hi>puniſhment is not of the ſame kinde,</hi> but various under the different Juriſdictions.</p>
            <p>§ 18. We ſay then, if religious matters be underſtood of that <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goodneſs,</hi> fundamentally neceſſary to all actions becoming a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Commonwealth,</hi> then ſo far the Chriſtian Magiſtrate hath power more or leſs, ſo far as may conduce to the due maintaining of the <hi>being or well-being</hi> of a Chriſtian State; and therefore is to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator unriuſque Tabulae,</hi> he hath the conſervation of <hi>the ſecond Table</hi> committed to his care, that it may be a civil State; of the firſt, that it may be a Chriſtian State. And therefore as a Family is to preſerve the honour and juſtice of the Moral Law by an <hi>Oeconomick Sanction,</hi> and the Church by an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick,</hi> ſo the civil State by <hi>Civil San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> each according to their juſt derived Laws whereby they are reſpectively to govern, and diſtinctly to adminiſter.</p>
            <p>§ 19. The great Queſtion here is, <hi>How far the Magiſtrates power extends in the making and execution of Penal Statutes?</hi> We have ſhewed that the Lord Jeſus hath not reſerved to himſelf ſo neer a propriety in the government of <hi>civil States,</hi> as of his Church; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken it as his <hi>peculiar Prerogative</hi> to give Laws unto his Church: and preſides there as the only <hi>Legiſlator.</hi> But unto States he hath onely given them the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of the Moral Law, and hath allowed unto them a <hi>Legiſlative power</hi> in all matters concerning the various Exigences, and divers Requiſites, with attending Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the due management of <hi>State-juriſdiction;</hi> ſo as the ſaid Laws are promoting of the common Peace and Juſtice of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and deducible from and founded on the ſaid Rules of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive and Commutative Juſtice.</p>
            <p>§ 20. The Laws of men that are <hi>juſt and reaſonable,</hi> may take place in all things conducing to the being and well-being of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Commonwealth,</hi> both as to the matters of the <hi>firſt and ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> ſo far as is neceſſary to the managing of it under the due qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a <hi>civil State;</hi> and therefore may not onely puniſh crimes committed againſt the <hi>ſecond Table,</hi> but ſuch as are againſt the firſt alſo. And there are theſe eſpecially that they are concerned in: 1. <hi>Blaſpheming of the true God,</hi> under which is comprehended com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profane ſwearing, tranſgreſſion eſpecially of the <hi>third Command.</hi> 2. <hi>Worſhipping of falſe Gods;</hi> a ſin againſt the firſt Commandment. 3. <hi>Idolatry, or the worſhipping of God by Images;</hi> a ſin againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment. 4. <hi>Prophanation of ſuch times as is by God
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:135610:64"/>appropriated to himſelf for publick Worſhip;</hi> a ſin againſt the fourth. So that theſe are palpable as to matter of fact, clear as to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the offence, and of dangerous conſequences, tending to the eminent ruine and apparent danger <hi>of a civil State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 21. In the concernments of the <hi>ſecond Table,</hi> God hath left the civil Magiſtrate more Arbitrary in making or executing civil Laws, as the neceſſity of the <hi>State doth require,</hi> laying the general Rules of Moral Juſtice, and the particular and relative benefit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth and Subject before his eyes. Now in the matters of the <hi>firſt Table</hi> (being the moral Rule of duty towards God) he onely requires the Magiſtrate to puniſh and reſtrain thoſe Vices in this kind that are <hi>notorious, infectious,</hi> and <hi>peſtilent</hi> to a Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, in matters of natural Worſhip; reſerving <hi>inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> built fundamentally on the ſame precepts, to another manner of diſpenſation, wherein the civil Magiſtrate is not to intermeddle as ſuch, neither as to <hi>Legiſlation, nor Execution</hi> of Penalties, nor <hi>deliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Officers.</p>
            <p>§ 22. As <hi>Murthers, Rapines, Adulteries, Perjuries,</hi> &amp;c. are deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Properties, Communities, and Relations, and ſo to all civility in a State where ſuch Vices predominate, and are not generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by Juſtice, it cannot be denominated a civil State, but rather a Pagan Salvage nation. So, where <hi>falſe Gods</hi> are multiplied and worſhipped, the <hi>true God</hi> is blaſphemed openly and notoriouſly, and all times for <hi>publick Worſhip</hi> of him by his own appointment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned publickly and generally: And ſuch Vices not ſuppreſſed by Magiſtrates, ſuch a State cannot be called a Chriſtian civil State, but Heatheniſh, whatever moral Juſtice there is between man and man.</p>
            <p>§ 23. Though all ſins be alike breaches of Gods Law, yet none but thoſe of a more <hi>groſs, external,</hi> and <hi>exemplary nature,</hi> fall under the cognizance of mans Juſtice. The <hi>Blaſphemy, Profaneneſs,</hi> and <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> of the heart, are not puniſhable by man; it muſt come to the Magiſtrate <hi>per allegata &amp; probata,</hi> that ſuch an one <hi>blaſphemed God, worſhipped an Idol, prophaned the Name of God by ſwearing,</hi> &amp;c. and that openly, either in contempt of that God that is worſhipped, or that Worſhip ſet up, or in order to the <hi>deluſion</hi> and <hi>ſeduction</hi> of others: for it would ſeem very hard to break into the private hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or appartments of <hi>Idolaters</hi> that may dwell in the land, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed judicially againſt them for that Religion which they are peacibly retired to, without any endeavour to <hi>publiſh</hi> or <hi>prvpagate</hi> to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:135610:64"/>of the publick, or infection of others. But no Magiſtrate ought to ſuffer that God to be <hi>openly blaſphemed,</hi> which he worſhips: If Heathens in a falſe Worſhip are zealous upon this account, how much more ought Chriſtians? Though no Magiſtrate can enforce any Subject to worſhip his God, or ought to do it by a Penal Law, as hath been ſaid, yet he may <hi>puniſh him for blaſpheming</hi> him, or for <hi>ſeducing any</hi> from the Worſhip of the true God; yea, for <hi>Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing from the Worſhip</hi> of the true God, after he hath owned it. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Perſidents, in the Old Teſtament, are pregnant to theſe purpoſes, which I need not enlarge on; thoſe that read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are acquainted with them: But we finde no Precept nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for endeavouring to reduce a poor Heathen from bare Idolatry to the Worſhip of the true God, by <hi>pecuniary Mulcts and corporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments;</hi> and I am ſure Chriſt never practiſed it nor commanded it in the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>§ 24. The great difficulty that yet attends this caſe (allowing the Magiſtrate a power, as ſuch, in ſome matters concerning our duty directly to Godward) what are <hi>adaequate and proportionate Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties</hi> in ſuch caſes as theſe: for the Magiſtrates power is always inſignificant, whatever the Law is, if there be not a <hi>Penalty</hi> annexed to it, and vigour in the <hi>juſt execution</hi> thereof. Now the Enquiry is, Of what <hi>kind and degree of puniſhments</hi> of ſuch Tranſgreſſions, ought to be? <hi>Anſw.</hi> I apprehend it is a hard thing to determine to all mens ſatisfaction; I know ſome have recourſe to the proceedings of the <hi>Judicial Law,</hi> which was but the reduction of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> into <hi>Civil Practice</hi> for the State of the Jews, and look upon them as binding to Chriſtian Magiſtrates. But I ſuppoſe the Judicial Laws to be rather preſidential onely, that Chriſtian Magiſtrates may take a meaſure thereby for the <hi>degree of Penalty,</hi> ſetting aſide their different Emergencies of State, and extraordinary caſes, when God would make one ſinner in a caſe exemplary to all ages, by his Prerogative and ſpecial Command; as in <hi>Achans theft,</hi> and the <hi>prophanation of the Sabbath</hi> by picking up of ſticks: And ſetting aſide much of the ſeverity which appeared in that more legal Diſpenſation, which was both <hi>Typical</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> and much of it in ſpecial caſes, and by ſpecial command by God; It would be accounted very ſevere now to put a man to death for prophaning the Name of God, though it were by repeated acts of ſuch horrid curſing and ſwearing as is frequent now-a-days; or for <hi>prophanation of the Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c. Then ſetting aſide the relation the <hi>Judicial Law</hi> had to the <hi>Levitical,</hi> and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:135610:65"/>neceſſary dependance on it, which is ceaſed; and conſidering that our Judicial Laws cannot ſo much depend upon Evangelical inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Worſhip, Chriſt having not ſo ſtrictly tyed Church and State under a neceſſity of the ſame Emergencies as he did the <hi>Jewiſh Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomies;</hi> I conceive likewiſe the juſt proportionating of Penalties in this kind, ought to be done with great caution, and depends much on the Magiſtrates prudent management of the Helm of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for the ſafety and preſervation of the <hi>Chriſtian State;</hi> and Penalties cannot be poſitive and unalterable, becauſe caſes do ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently differ in the aggravating circumſtances.</p>
            <p>§ 25. The Chriſtian civil State ought to be very <hi>neighbourly and cheriſhing</hi> to the Eccleſiaſtical; and the civil Magiſtrate is to improve his Magiſtratick capacity to the utmoſt, for the intereſt of Chriſt's Church, and advantage of the Goſpel. 1. By ſubordinating as much as is poſſible, all <hi>State-intereſt</hi> to the intereſt of Chriſt in his Church. 2. By giving all <hi>poſſible encouragement</hi> to the purer Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of God, and to the embracers of the Chriſtian Religion. 3. By <hi>encouraging</hi> the faithful preaching of the Goſpel, and propagation thereof by able Miniſters duely called thereto by the Church, and affording them external helps and ſupports in ſo doing. 4. By maintaining the Churches in the due execution of the Laws of Chriſt, and in the enjoyment of their Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, defending them from invaſions and diſturbances in Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, from the rage of profeſſed Enemies, from tyrannizing uſurping Impoſers. 5. By being a nurſing Father to the Church, both as <hi>a Chriſtian in an eminent capacity,</hi> going before others in the exemplary practice of Piety, and calling upon all others of all ranks and degrees whatever, to diſcharge their places in <hi>the fear of God,</hi> as <hi>Hezekiak and Jehoſaphat</hi> did, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25, 26, 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8, 9, 10. and as a Magiſtrate defending them by his power, as hath been ſaid.</p>

            </head>
            <p>§ 1. IN the next place it will be neceſſary to ſpeak ſomething to a Queſtion of no leſs weight than any of the former: for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:135610:65"/>(it is ſaid) that though it ſhould be granted that no power, Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, can <hi>(Jure) convert Indifferencies in Worſhip into Neceſſities</hi> by a Law, yet it's inquired in caſe any humane power aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſo much to it ſelf as to do it, Whether a <hi>Chriſtian is not bound to yield active Obedience unto the ſaid Laws?</hi> and thoſe that affirm it, produce theſe Reaſons to enforce it. 1. <hi>That every one is bound to be ſubject to their higheſt powers,</hi> Rom. 13.1. 2. <hi>That ſuch Laws are not contrary to the Law of God,</hi> becauſe God hath nowhere declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt one part of the indifferency more than the other, but hath left both equally lawful to be practiſed, according to the rules of diſcretion. And why may not the Church or <hi>Magiſtrates diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> binde a Chriſtian to obedience to his command, as <hi>moſt expedient,</hi> the Church or Magiſtrate being better able to judge of an <hi>Expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> than a private Chriſtian? 3. Becauſe if in a thing indifferent the <hi>leaſt offenſive</hi> part is to be choſen, then ſurely that part which fulfils the Civil or Eccleſiaſtick Law; for it is a greater offence to offend the Church or Magiſtrate, or both, than to offend a particular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian, or company of Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>To the firſt I anſwer, by way of conceſſion, That a Chriſtian is ſo bound, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. but 1. That place is to be underſtood <hi>of Civil,</hi> not Eccleſiaſtical powers, as the Context ſhews. 2. If it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Church-power,</hi> as that <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you;</hi> it's to be underſtood of ſuch, as Chriſt hath conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Church-Officers; and of obedience to an Executive power committed to them, not of a new <hi>aſſumed Legiſlative power</hi> never allowed to them.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, That ſuch Laws are contrary to the Word of God: for 1. <hi>Eſſentially</hi> they are contrary to the Word of God, it being the revealed Will of God in his Word, that they ſhould be Indifferencies, and remain ſo, not to be made otherwiſe by any Law: for where God hath granted a Liberty or Latitude in the uſe of any Creatures or Actions, there to make or preſcribe a religious limitation by a Law, is <hi>abſolutely unlawful, and directly contrary to the Word of God.</hi> It's expreſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.13, 14, 15. where <hi>Peter,</hi> though an Apoſtle, is charged not to put a religious difference where God hath ſanctified things to our indifferent uſe, much leſs might he prohibit the Church from uſing any Creatures or Actions made by God indifferently holy: therefore when it's the Will of God that a thing be indifferent, it's contrary to the Will of God to impoſe it as neceſſary. 2. Such Laws are <hi>circumſtantially evil, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:135610:66"/>contrary to the Word of God,</hi> becauſe they hinder the free uſe of <hi>Chriſtian diſcretion</hi> where God would have it uſed; and <hi>Ergo,</hi> hindreth an Ordinance of Chriſt. Beſides, it neceſſarily <hi>obligeth to evil,</hi> whenas the expedient good is found by a Chriſtian to be in that part of the Indifferency which is contrary to the humane Law: And beſides, God having left both parts of the Indifferency equally lawful, and declared it ſo in his Word, for man to declare one part unlawful, or make it ſo by a Law, is to make a Declaration or Law contrary to the Word of God. Neither may a Magiſtrate or Churches judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment binde a Chriſtian to practiſe any further than it brings light with it: for no man muſt walk by an implicit Faith in the matters that concern the Worſhip of God, and the ſalvation of his Soul.</p>
            <p>To <hi>the third Alleg.</hi> That part which fulfils the Civil or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law for <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> is not the leaſt offending part, but the moſt: for the yielding free active obedience to ſinful Laws, is not onely ſin in the <hi>perſon obeying,</hi> but the higheſt degree of ſcandal to the <hi>perſon commanding,</hi> it being the edification of him in ſin; whereas the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of <hi>active obedience</hi> in ſuch a caſe, is no offence given, but onely a juſt <hi>croſs of a perverſe Judgment and Will.</hi> Again, if any action be ſuch as will offend juſtly the leaſt of Chriſt's members, it muſt needs be contrary to Gods Word; and I may not grievingly or ſinningly offend any of Gods children, that I may gratifie and fulfil the Will of man. We muſt rather chuſe that part of the Indifferency which a weak Chriſtian thinks (according to his beſt light from Gods Word) to be neceſſary, than the other part which Authority lays a ſtreſs upon by a Law: the reaſon is, becauſe I muſt chuſe <hi>Suffering</hi> rather than indanger <hi>any Souls ſalvation in the leaſt.</hi> Now if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe active obedience to the Magiſtrate, I onely run the hazard <hi>of ſuffering the penalty,</hi> which it may be I can bear and comfort my ſelf under; but in caſe I wrong a Soul by my action, I cannot free my ſelf from ſin, and am an occaſion of anothers too; either of which are, but eſpecially both, much heavier than the greateſt ſuffering. Laſtly, if I ſuffer the penalty of the Law, I both fulfil the Law, and ſave my Brother too.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Now theſe Obſtacles being removed out of the way, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to determine the <hi>Queſtion. That in caſe any power Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, ſhall preſume ſo far as to enact Laws in the concerns of divine Worſhip, ſo as to change Chriſtian Indifferencies into Neceſſities, that a Chriſtian is bound to refuſe, active obedience thereto.</hi> And I make good this Aſſertion by the following Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:135610:66"/>1. To yield ſuch obedience, is to ſerve God according <hi>to the Will of Man;</hi> but no Chriſtian ought to ſerve God according <hi>to the Will of Man: Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is true, becauſe it's a ſerving God in ſuch a way as is deviſed by man, and to the obeyer is no other; for he in his conſcience believes ſo, that <hi>it is not the Will of God.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is true, becauſe that is Will-Worſhip which is the product only <hi>of mans Will, Gods Will</hi> being the onely Rule of Gods Worſhip; and we muſt be ſure of that Will in all matters of his Worſhip, or elſe we bring vain Oblations unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The goodneſs determined by a <hi>humane Law</hi> for the ſake of <hi>mans Will,</hi> ought not to be preferred before the goodneſs of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency determined (by a conſcientious Chriſtian) for God's ſake; for ſuch a <hi>goodneſs of Expediency</hi> is approved of by God, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> is unlawful: therefore from this cloſing with ſuch goodneſs, we are not to be deterred by any humane Law; for an expediently neceſſary action, according to the Will of God, is to be of far more force with us, than an action made abſolutely neceſſary by the Will of man. Yea, it is to do a thing contrary to the Will of God, to do that as neceſſary which God hath revealed his Will concerning that we ſhould always do in a way of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency and Expediency, determinable by the judgment of diſcretion: for to do things by way of Neceſſity, and to do by way of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, is to act by way of Contrariety; and therefore to obey ſuch Laws, is to act contrary to the Will of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To be brought under the <hi>power (i. e.</hi> a neceſſity by a Law) of any thing religiouſly indifferent, is unlawful, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. but to be brought to conſtant active obedience to mans Law, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a neceſſary performance of an <hi>indifferent action,</hi> is to be brought under the power of a thing, <hi>i. e.</hi> into bondage, <hi>i. e.</hi> under a Yoke which Chriſt never put us under. Now Chriſt would not have us to make <hi>our ſelves ſlaves</hi> where he hath made <hi>us free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A Chriſtian is to uſe his <hi>liberty purchaſed by Chriſt, and to ſtand faſt in it; Ergo,</hi> to practiſe it conſtantly, notwithſtanding all enſnaring and embondaging Laws of men, and is bound to uſe his judgment in all his actions; and where there is an <hi>Indifferency,</hi> to chuſe by the Rules of Expediency, and not walk by an <hi>implicite Faith. The wiſe mans eyes are in his head; the fool walketh in darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Such active obedience is a <hi>betraying the Prerogative of Chriſt:</hi> for if a Legiſlative power be Chriſt's Prerogative, as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then the yielding active obedience to an uſurping Law, is the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:135610:67"/>doing Homage to another Lawgiver in that kind, and giving up the power of the Lord Jeſus. It's like a Subjects introducing the power of a <hi>forreign Prince,</hi> and doing all that lies in him to ſubvert that Law and Soveraignty to which he is naturally related; and what can be greater Treaſon to any State?</p>
            <p n="6">6. If a Chriſtian here obey, it muſt be for <hi>Chriſt's ſake,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. It cannot be for <hi>Chriſt's ſake,</hi> becauſe it robs him of his Prerogative, or betrays it; neither can it be for <hi>Conſcience ſake,</hi> to embondage it ſelf where Chriſt hath left it free: whatever tends to the captivity or ſlavery of Conſcience, is not for the good of Conſcience; for in this they are not Miniſters to me for good, for the Law tends not to my good in active obedience; which if I ſee, and yet yield, I become a Miniſter of evil to my ſelf.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If it be a ſin in the ſupream Powers to <hi>command and impoſe</hi> their ſaid Laws, it is a ſin in a Chriſtian <hi>to obey; at. Ergo.</hi> The conſequence is manifeſt, becauſe the moſt formal reaſon <hi>of an evil Law, is the evil obedience required.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> hath been proved, that ſuch a Law is ſin in Superiours to make: but <hi>to confirm the conſequence</hi> further, to be a copartner with another in ſin, is ſin; but if the Magiſtrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and I obey, <hi>I am copartner with him.</hi> A thing commanded can be evil but two ways; either <hi>materially, or circumſtantially:</hi> if it be materially evil, there is no pretence for doing it, whatever <hi>humane power command;</hi> and if it be <hi>circumſtantially,</hi> it muſt be in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders uſurping a falſe power, or there is ſome circumſtantial <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> that makes it unlawful unto me or another. It may be the thing may be <hi>materially lawful,</hi> but under both theſe ſorts of circumſtances; it may be unlawful, as that I give away hereby Chriſt's Prerogative, I rob my ſelf of the uſe of <hi>my judgment of diſcretion,</hi> by which every Chriſtian is to walk, and I (it may be) offend my brother. I do not ſay a man may never do that part of the <hi>Indifferency that is commanded by a humane Law;</hi> a Chriſtian hath the uſe of his liberty as well after as before a <hi>humane Law,</hi> and he is to walk by the Rule of Expediency ſtill. When he finds it moſt for Gods glory, and his or anothers edification, he may take that part of <hi>the Indifferency</hi> which is commanded, <hi>ſed non ratione praecepti humani,</hi> but from that Expedient or convenient Goodneſs which <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> he finds in it. But that obedience which we here declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, is the doing it as a <hi>duty conſtantly or conſcientiouſly, ſub paenâ reatus,</hi> by virtue of ſuch a Law.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A Chriſtian cannot yield the aforeſaid obedience, but he muſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:135610:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>offer <hi>violence to his Conſcience,</hi> i. e. practically to contradict the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates and light thereof; for every moral action muſt be <hi>approved or reprobated</hi> thereby. But he muſt needs know that that which is not commanded, or approved by Chriſt (as indifferent things are, though not commanded by him) in the matters of his Worſhip, (no others approbation being enough to juſtifie my actions, and therefore to ſatisfie my Conſcience) is but <hi>Innovation,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>vain Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Ergo,</hi> rejected by Chriſt, and ſinful, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. Now that which a Chriſtian is perſwaded of to be thus in his own Conſcience, and yet doth, he offers manifeſt <hi>violence to his Conſcience in doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. If ſuch Compulſions do by <hi>Rules of Expediency</hi> neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a man to refuſe active obedience, then it's a <hi>duty</hi> at leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>to refuſe;</hi> but <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Minor is proved beyond all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, from <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine and practice concerning the uſe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.5. &amp; <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.19, 20, 21, 22.</p>

            </head>
            <p>§ 1. THe uſual grand Evaſion of what hath been ſaid, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Church cannot make Laws contrary to the Word, yet ſhe may make <hi>Laws beſides the Word,</hi> i.e. new Laws which Chriſt never made: and if ſhe make ſuch Laws which are not contrary to the Word, (i.e. <hi>directly and materially</hi>) ſhe is to be obeyed by every conſcientious Chriſtian. For Anſwer, I premiſe theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Laws for <hi>divine Worſhip</hi> are enacted by Chriſt, or not: if enacted, we queſtion not the obeying of them; if not, let any one ſhew by virtue of what divine Authority we muſt obey them, for we cannot obey them without.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As Chriſt never deputed any humane Legiſlative Authority in his Church, ſo he never allowed any <hi>to rectifie and correct</hi> his Laws by adding to their penalties, and making them more ſevere, and giving ſuch expreſs and <hi>explicite Authority,</hi> which he hath left <hi>implicite and conſequentially onely;</hi> and thoſe things <hi>more neceſſary,</hi> which he hath
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:135610:68"/>
               <hi>left leſs:</hi> Chriſt blamed the Phariſees for ſo doing, and not allowed any Churches or Chriſtians ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It would be groſly impudent if the Church ſhould <hi>pretend</hi> to a power of making Laws <hi>contrary to the Word of God,</hi> though they ſhould be ſo; therefore they cannot pretend to this Law-making power in any thing but what ſhe ſaith is in it ſelf indifferent: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe can pretend onely to the making a <hi>new additional</hi> Law for Chriſt, ſuch as he never made, and for and in ſuch things which he thought beſt in his wiſdom to leave indifferent. But the Church finds a <hi>miſtake</hi> in that firſt Conſtitution, and thinks beſt to make ſuch things neceſſary; thinks that Chriſt left <hi>too few ceremonies</hi> and <hi>ſignificant ſignes:</hi> and therefore enacts more Laws beſides the Word, not contrary to what he hath enacted and eſtabliſhed already.</p>
            <p>§ 2. But <hi>I ſhall now prove that all humane Laws and Conſtitutions in matters of divine Worſhip, beſides the Word, are contrary to the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That which is not the <hi>revealed Will of God</hi> for his Worſhip in his Word, <hi>is contrary to the Word of God;</hi> but humane Conſtitutions and Laws for divine Worſhip, are not the <hi>revealed Will of God</hi> in his Word: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major is true,</hi> becauſe the Word is the revealed Will of God; and that Rule of Worſhip which is not the revealed Will of God, is contrary to the revealed Will of God for his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for <hi>Revealed and not Revealed, are contradicentia,</hi> as <hi>juſtus &amp; non juſtus, honeſtum &amp; non honeſtum;</hi> and <hi>contradicentia</hi> will never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied (by any good Logicians) to be <hi>contraria:</hi> therefore the <hi>revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Will of God</hi> in his Word, and not the <hi>revealed Will of God</hi> in his Word, are contraries, or there is no contraries in the world. The Minor carries <hi>its evidence</hi> from the very terms: for <hi>what is beſide the Word,</hi> is <hi>beſide the Will of God</hi> in the Word, and not to be found there; for whatever is found to be the Will of God in the Word, <hi>poſitively</hi> or <hi>conſequentially,</hi> ſo obligeth as a Law of God to obedience, according to the true intent and meaning thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whatever be humane Laws for the Worſhip of God beſides the Word, are at the beſt <hi>but the Will of man,</hi> that thoſe things ſhould be neceſſary in the Worſhip of God, which Chriſt hath willed indifferent, and revealed in his Word ſo to be; but for man to <hi>will thoſe things to be neceſſary in the Worſhip of God, which Chriſt hath willed and revealed in his Word to be indifferent,</hi> is to will or make a Law <hi>contrary to the revealed Will</hi> of Chriſt in his Word, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the matter of the Law; for <hi>neceſſary and indifferent are adverſa,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo <hi>contraria:</hi> if the oppoſites be <hi>neceſſary and not neceſſary, they are contradicentia,</hi> and they are <hi>contraria</hi> as before.</p>
            <p n="3">

Whatever is not according to the <hi>Will of God in the Word,</hi> is <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Will of God in his Word;</hi> but all ſuch <hi>humane Laws</hi> beſides the Word, <hi>are not according</hi> to the Word: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is true, becauſe all actions are <hi>agreeable to the Word by being according to the Word,</hi> and <hi>diſagreeing</hi> by not being according to the Word; and ſo <hi>are contrary to the Word,</hi> and are really <hi>contradicentia:</hi> for <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to,</hi> and <hi>not according to,</hi> referring to the ſame ſubject, are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicentia,</hi> every action being according or not according, and ſo contrary or not contrary to the Word of God. <hi>Minor:</hi> I prove ſuch Laws beſides the Word are not according to the Word; the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (of beſides the Word) is, that there is <hi>no ground for it in the Word,</hi> and therefore that cannot be according to the Rule laid down in the Word; for that were to be built upon, and to be juſtified by it: a man cannot <hi>ſit upon a ſeat and ſit beſides it</hi> at the ſame time; the ſame water poured cannot fall <hi>in the Cup</hi> and <hi>beſides it</hi> too: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Law cannot claim <hi>a Sanction from the Word,</hi> is not according to it, <hi>therefore beſides it,</hi> or againſt it; as Chriſt ſaith, Whoever is not for me, is againſt me. The Word doth either <hi>juſtifie</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> all actions; and thoſe Laws that are not <hi>juſtified</hi> at leaſt <hi>by Chriſt's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> are condemned by the Word of God.</p>
            <p>§ 3. 4. Whatever is contrary to the <hi>Legiſlative Prerogative</hi> of Chriſt maintained in his Word, is contrary to the Word; but ſuch humane Laws and Conſtitutions beſides the Word, are contrary to the <hi>Legiſlative Prerogative</hi> of Chriſt: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is clear, becauſe <hi>every truth</hi> maintained and defended by the Word, <hi>is the Word;</hi> and whatever is <hi>contrary to that truth,</hi> is contrary to the truth of the Word. And what truth is more clearly atteſted, and firmly ratified, than this <hi>Prerogative of Chriſt?</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is clear, becauſe nothing can <hi>detract</hi> more than a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> in this kind: What can detract more from the Legiſlative power of King and Parliament, than for a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration or any inferiour combination of men, to <hi>aſſume</hi> this power to themſelves?</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>To adde any thing</hi> to the revealed Will of Chriſt, in matters of ſpiritual concern, is contrary to the <hi>Word of the Old and New Teſtaments, Deut.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. but to make ſuch Laws, is to adde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe ſuch Laws (by our ſuppoſition) being <hi>beſides the Word,</hi> we have proved to be no <hi>parts of it;</hi> and <hi>Ergo, additions to his Laws</hi> and inſtitutions in the Word, which are perfect and entire in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for Doctrine and Diſcipline <hi>in divine Service and Worſhip;</hi> and theſe Laws of humane enaction (whatever pretences are put upon
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:135610:69"/>them) being for the ſame end and uſe, muſt needs <hi>be additional.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. To <hi>teach for Doctrines the commands of men, is contrary</hi> to the Word of Chriſt; but all humane Conſtitutions of this kind ſpecified beſides the Word, are but Commands of men taught for Doctrines. The Major is true and undeniable, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.9. where ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Commands are charged by Chriſt for the intolerable ſin of the Phariſees. Compare with this place that in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, quoted and applied to them by our Saviour, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.14. <hi>Their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men;</hi> or which our Saviour (the beſt Interpreter of Scripture) ſaith, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me;</hi> producing this from the Prophet, <hi>Their fear is taught by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men;</hi> not but that they obſerved alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> his Commands, but becauſe they ſet up their Poſts with Gods, their Laws with Gods Laws: and this is that which Chriſt condemns. This Argument is cleared, and fully proſecuted by another very lately, (in a learned Exerc. on <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. and <hi>Mark</hi> 9.13.) <hi>And therefore I ſhall not actum agere.</hi> As <hi>to the Minor,</hi> it's evident that ſuch Legiſlators teach for Doctrine their own Laws: for they preſs them <hi>doctrinally</hi> on the people, and charge it as <hi>their duty</hi> to walk in the practice of active obedience unto ſuch Laws, and condemn all ſuch as refuſe ſuch obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (upon any pretence whatſoever) as diſobedient to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Schiſmaticks.</p>

            </head>
            <p>§ 1. LEſt it ſhould be replied to our preceding Diſcourſe, That although the <hi>civil Magiſtrate</hi> cannot of himſelf be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Compiler or Eſtabliſher of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Laws, Canons,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,</hi> unleſs they be firſt <hi>compiled, approved, and propounded</hi> by the Church to the Magiſtrate, to compleat their Sanction and Law-rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <hi>with the impreſs</hi> of his Authority; yet the Church and civil Magiſtrate <hi>both together,</hi> have a <hi>compleat Legiſlative power</hi> in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Affairs. The Church is ſuppoſed to act by its <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> in a <hi>Convocation, Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> or <hi>Synod,</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> lawfully aſſembled by the call of the Magiſtrate. The <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, <hi>Whether after they have agreed on Eccleſiaſtical Canons and Conſtitutions, the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:135610:69"/>civil Magiſtrate may give Sanction to them, by making them Penal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes?</hi> The Queſtion in brief is, <hi>Whether Eccleſiaſtical Laws may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Penal Statutes by Magiſtratick Sanction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. In order to the right reſolving of this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> it's fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire firſt concerning the nature or <hi>ſubject-matter</hi> of the ſaid Canons and Conſtitutions, whether the <hi>Compoſers</hi> and <hi>Propoſers</hi> thereof do believe them to conſiſt of ſuch things as Chriſt hath left <hi>indifferent,</hi> and they would have to be <hi>neceſſiary?</hi> or do they conſiſt of ſuch things as they have by <hi>diſquiſition</hi> found to be neceſſary by virtue of the Will of Chriſt? for the end of ſuch Aſſemblies is to confer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Will of Chriſt in the <hi>great and weightier</hi> matters of the Church, for the clearing up of what is dark and dubious before. Now if the mind of Chriſt be diſcovered, there needs no more <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> where <hi>the word of a King is, there is power.</hi> Make it but out by the <hi>cleareſt demonſtrations,</hi> that this or that is the mind of Chriſt, there needs none of the <hi>Magiſtrates penalties</hi> to be annexed; it hath force enough of it ſelf to <hi>reach the Conſcience,</hi> which is the end of Chriſt's Laws, and to charge guilt upon it in caſe of diſobedience; and that is more than all <hi>the Penal Laws</hi> of men can do. It's need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to enquire whether the <hi>Magiſtrates Sanction</hi> be by way of <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi> onely, or by way of <hi>eminent commendation</hi> of the ſaid Laws to his Subject; not annexing or executing <hi>any Penalty</hi> himſelf, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing onely ſome <hi>ſpiritual Penalty</hi> annexed by Chriſt or his Church, to be executed by Church-Officers? or whether he will annex or cauſe to be executed any <hi>external Penalty</hi> by his civil Officers, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall ſerve? The matter being thus ſtated, I proceed in the Negative.</p>
            <p>§ 3. 1. We have abundantly evidenced, that in the matters of Indifferencies in Religion, no <hi>power on Earth</hi> may make any Laws, changing them into things <hi>religiouſly neceſſary.</hi> 2. Where did Chriſt ever joyn Magiſtrates and Miniſters together <hi>in joynt Commiſſion</hi> in the government of his Church? 3. If ſo, why may not Magiſtrates joyn in the <hi>judicial proceedings</hi> of the Church, and fit as <hi>due Judges</hi> in all Spiritual Courts, and excommunicate and abſolve? He that hath a ſhare in <hi>Legiſlation,</hi> may reſerve to himſelf the <hi>executive part</hi> at his own pleaſure. 4. If ſuch <hi>Church-Laws</hi> are invalid without the Magiſtrates Sanction, then he hath a <hi>negative voice</hi> over the Church to ſtop any Church-proceedings in Legiſlation or Execution; and indeed it's happy for ſome people that it is ſo, elſe the <hi>Clergie</hi> (that call themſelves the Church) would make mad work, were
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:135610:70"/>not the civil State wiſer and more moderate, and by its power able to put a ſtop ſometimes to their <hi>mad Carreers.</hi> 5. The Decrees of the <hi>Apoſtles, Elders,</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> (being only a declaration of the mind of Chriſt in a difficult caſe) became a Law to the Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch <hi>Magiſtatick ratification,</hi> or <hi>annexation of Penalty.</hi> 6. Chriſt never annexed any <hi>corporal</hi> or <hi>eſtate-Penalties</hi> to any of his Laws that he ſetled his Church with at the firſt. 7. Chriſt provided ſo for the <hi>due government</hi> of his Churches, that nothing might be wanting for the adminiſtration of Government and Ordinances, in the worſt of times, when moſt perſecuted and oppoſed by thoſe Magiſtrates in whoſe Dominions they did <hi>militate.</hi> The Church of Chriſt would be but in a very <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>lame condition</hi> in moſt Kingdoms and Ages, if the Magiſtrates countenance and concurrence were an <hi>Eſſential Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement</hi> of its due ſtate of Eccleſiaſtick government; and that can never be accounted a right <hi>Model</hi> of Church-government, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>erected</hi> without the Kings and Princes of the Earth ſet their hands to it: For if it were ſo, Chriſt ſhould have few <hi>duely</hi> govern'd Churches on Earth, that ſort of men being oftner found <hi>pulling down</hi> than ſetting up the Kingdom of Chriſt. Laſtly, we having already proved that neither Church-Officers nor Civil have any <hi>Legiſlative power</hi> in the ſaid matters, and therefore being put together, they are but as two <hi>Cyphers</hi> that make not ſo much as an <hi>

In particular, how and what things are to be done ſo to attain theſe ends. Firſt, ſpeaking with Tongues ſhould be <hi>with interpretation,</hi> verſ. 27, 28.

Whence I gather, that walking <hi>according to Order,</hi> is in the practice of <hi>Canonical Obedience</hi> to the Rules of the Goſpel; that is, in a due ſubmiſſion to and practice of all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, without <hi>diſtraction and confuſion;</hi> God being the God of Order, and not of Confuſion.</p>

And though the mode and order of Actions and Geſtures may be the ſame <hi>materially</hi> that we uſe in <hi>civil Decencies</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> yet the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation</hi> being to contradiſtinct Objects, and their purport and deſigne of the ſaid Actions and Modes thereof, they are juſtly reputed of another nature, and receive <hi>contradiſtinct Denominations.</hi>

            <p>§ 7. <hi>Religious Decency and Order</hi> is either of <hi>merely Moral,</hi> or of <hi>inſtituted Original.</hi> Moral (and therefore called Natural) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Worſhip, are uſually and aptly oppoſed; for ſuch as are of <hi>Moral Original,</hi> are comprehended in, or directly deducible from the precepts of the Moral Law, as all reverent and humble geſtures of the Creature before the Creator, ſuch as <hi>ſtanding, kneeling, proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. which for the moſt part are onely generally propounded ſo far as they may hold forth a <hi>proportionate</hi> external indication of the ſolemnity of our Undertakings; neither may they become any more <hi>definite</hi> by mans Law, than God himſelf hath determied. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: No man can make a Law to tye us up to any particular ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in Prayer, as to kneeling, ſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe God hath left it indifferent to a Chriſtians election to govern himſelf by the Rules of <hi>Expediency,</hi> ſo he have a reſpect to the general Obligation, <hi>viz.</hi> that it be ſuch as is <hi>reverent,</hi> and becoming our attendance on God in ſuch an Ordinance.</p>
            <p>§ 8. <hi>Decencies and Order</hi> belonging to <hi>inſtituted Worſhip,</hi> are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from merely <hi>moral Worſhip,</hi> and required by ſome more ſpecial Commandment of Chriſt in the <hi>diſciplining of his Church;</hi> and they differ as the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Church doth. The <hi>Levitical Oeconomy</hi> made Levitical Decencies and Order neceſſary, in mode and manner of the Jewiſh Worſhip then required in thoſe of <hi>Offerings, Sacrifices, Buildings, Geſtures, Veſtures, Waſhings;</hi> all which, as ſhadows, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and were actually aboliſhed, with the whole ſubſtance of the Ceremonial Law, when the Body approached: And therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce into Goſpel-worſhip, Modes proportionate and adapted to <hi>Moſaical</hi> Services, <hi>viz. Prieſts, Ephods, Altars, Sacrifices,</hi> &amp;c. is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the revealed Will of Chriſt, and an implicite denial of his being come in the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>§ 9. The <hi>Levitical Oeconomy,</hi> with all its Appendixes, being aboliſhed,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:135610:72"/>the <hi>Evangelical</hi> takes place; which are determined by the Law of Chriſt, as to the more and leſs ſubſtantial parts of Worſhip. And that we may be diſtinct about Goſpel-<hi>Decencies and Order,</hi> we muſt know, 1. That all merely <hi>moral Decencies</hi> are in force under the Goſpel, and needs no other Law to ratifie them than the <hi>Law of Chriſt,</hi> which hath always continued the moral Law, and its due circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Attendments under <hi>all changes</hi> of inſtituted Worſhip. 2. All <hi>Levitical Decencies and Order</hi> are aboliſhed by Chriſt's coming, when his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Oeconomy</hi> was changed. 3. All <hi>Evangelical Decencies and Order,</hi> as womens being covered and keeping ſilence in publick Aſſemblies, and ſuch as concern the Word and Sacraments, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently determined by Chriſt, by the precepts or practice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Apoſtles, and Primitive Church, that we need not betake our ſelves to <hi>Rome</hi> or any other pretended <hi>Law-making Church,</hi> to fetch new Preſcriptions in order to the compleating of the Worſhip of Chriſt. And whereas preſent Innovations of our Pretenders are pleaded for from the <hi>Primitive practice,</hi> I ſay no more but this, that when the Evidence of that <hi>Practice</hi> appears from God's Word, we will not ſcruple the imitation; but being impoſed upon us by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moſtly through <hi>Antichriſtian hands,</hi> or at beſt by very <hi>fallible</hi> and inconſiſtent Hiſtory; and if in many things true as to matter of fact, yet we finde them not juſtified by <hi>Sacred Authority,</hi> we dare not aſſent and conſent unto them.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Now if the Church knows of any more Decencies and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders needful to be uſed under the New Teſtament, and thoſe that are of <hi>moral intent confirmed by Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Evangelical</hi> of his laſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then let her plead and uſe her <hi>Legiſlative power</hi> (if ſhe have any <hi>jure</hi>) in eſtabliſhing the ſame: and if any ſhall or doth think notwithſtadding, that it's needful to eſtabliſh <hi>new decencies</hi> of humane invention by Church-Laws, we ſhall ſtill proceed further to evince the contrary.</p>
            <p>§ 11. If <hi>decency and order</hi> be ſtrained to the largeſt acceptation in the New Teſtament's ſence, they cannot be pretended to be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Evangelical decency and order,</hi> comprehending all moral and inſtituted decency and order which Chriſt hath appointed to be uſed in his Goſpel-Church; elſe how ſhould it come to be ſo? for that onely is Evangelical which <hi>Chriſt makes ſo,</hi> and calls ſo; every mimical Geſture and antick Veſture that any brainſick Church-man, or carnal Prieſts and Prelates, or any Convention of them ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, and chriſten with the name of Decency and Order, is not <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical.</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:135610:73"/>The Rules and Forms of Worſhip and Diſcipline which Chriſt hath left to his Church, are <hi>comely, grave, decent,</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi> enough, without any additaments and amendments proceeding from mens corrupt fancy and intereſt.</p>
            <p>§ 12. And that it's not lawful for the Church <hi>to make Laws</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh more decencies in the Worſhip of God than Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed or allowed, we have proved already; if they undergo the loweſt conſideration as matters of Indifferency, I ſhall onely adde a few words more.</p>
            <p>§ 13. <hi>Firſt,</hi> If it be lawful for the Church to annex <hi>new decencies</hi> and order to the decencies and order appointed by Chriſt, then theſe muſt be <hi>neceſſary or unneceſſary;</hi> but it's not lawful, <hi>Ergo.</hi> 1. It's not lawful to annex <hi>unneceſſary:</hi> for this were to trifle, and would infer the greateſt abſurdities imaginary; therefore none will inſiſt upon that. 2. Not to annex any thing neceſſary: for they muſt then judge ſomething <hi>neceſſary</hi> which Chriſt hath not declared ſo, (as ſomething belonging to the <hi>eſſe</hi> or <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of the Church;) and this were a high affront to Chriſt, and <hi>impeachment</hi> of his wiſdom, as not perfect and compleat in his Houſe; as likewiſe it's implicitely to condemn Chriſt's Worſhip and Ordinances (as left by him) for <hi>undecent</hi> and <hi>diſorderly,</hi> and ſo naked and unfit to come to publick view, till they be <hi>anew dreſſed up and trimed</hi> by the Church in her Poppet-play Robes and Attire.</p>
            <p>§ 14. <hi>Secondly,</hi> And then ſhe might re-eſtabliſh any <hi>old abſolete Jewiſh decencies,</hi> ſo ſhe uſe them <hi>Evangelically,</hi> upon as good or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ground than ſhe hath brought in Heatheniſh practices into uſe in the Church. <hi>Thirdly, Decency and Order</hi> in the Church, is no <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency,</hi> but <hi>neceſſary</hi> in its kind, (as hath been ſhewed) becauſe commanded and enjoyned by Chriſt; and <hi>Ergo,</hi> if the Church hath power to enact Laws in matters of <hi>Indifferency,</hi> it follows not that ſhe hath power to do the like in matters of <hi>Decency and Order,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not <hi>indifferent things,</hi> but <hi>neceſſary,</hi> if we underſtand either <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Evangelical decency and order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 15. It is fallacious and falſe to aſſert that the Church preſcribes onely <hi>decencies</hi> in the Worſhip of God; for they are the ſmalleſt part of her Ceremonies: for what are Holy-days, Croſs in Baptiſm, Muſick in Divine Service? And beſides, moſt or all her Ceremonies reſpect other Objects, and are for other <hi>ſignificancy</hi> and ends, than for <hi>decency;</hi> ſome being chiefly <hi>gratiâ divinâ,</hi> as all <hi>reverential Geſtures</hi> and <hi>Poſtures,</hi> viz. <hi>bowing at the Name of Jeſus, bowing to the Altar,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:135610:73"/>kneeling at the Sacrament, ſtanding up at the Goſpel.</hi> Theſe are ſignes of divine honour, and Latrical, and can be no otherwiſe underſtood than reſpecting a Divinity: and therefore there can be no pretence to call it civil Worſhip, becauſe in all <hi>civil Worſhip man is the Object;</hi> and were the ſame or like actions, which for the matter are neither civil or divine, but indifferent as to both, but a peculiar Adaptation to a <hi>ſingular end or object,</hi> they receive their <hi>diſtinct denomination</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. Some are chiefly <hi>gratiâ humanâ,</hi> in order to the due preparing and qualifying us for <hi>Spiritual Services; Surplices</hi> to make us <hi>appear more pure, &amp; an Emblem of Purity,</hi> and mind us of it; Muſick to raiſe the Spirits: and others more mixt in their intention, <hi>tàm gratiâ divinâ, quàm humanâ,</hi> as <hi>Saints days,</hi> wherein God is bleſſed for Saints, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God is honoured and the Saint too; the <hi>Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> and the Ring in Matrimony; which are Seals of obligation religiouſly made uſe of, (therefore more than ſignificant ſignes) and can be no leſs than <hi>Sacraments.</hi> There are alſo divers <hi>Reſponſes</hi> and <hi>Salutations</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Miniſters and People; in all which it's eaſie to perceive that there is ſome weightier matters reſpected than meer <hi>civil decencies and order,</hi> whatever pretences are made to the contrary.</p>
            <p>§ 16. We have before hinted what we apprehend true <hi>canonical obedience</hi> to be, <hi>viz.</hi> that it's not a ſubmiſſion to a <hi>certain body</hi> of Laws made by any Church challenging a <hi>Legiſlative power,</hi> neither to thoſe feigned <hi>Canons</hi> of the Apoſtles; but it is obedience to the <hi>Canons or Rules</hi> of Goſpel-communion laid down in the Scriptures: thoſe that are acquainted with the true Churches of Chriſt, know no other <hi>Canons,</hi> nor no other <hi>canonical Obedience</hi> they are obliged unto. Now thoſe that call for <hi>canonical obedience</hi> (under that term) they tell us that it is <hi>obedience</hi> to the Laws, Rules, and Conſtitutions of the Church; but I could never rightly underſtand any reaſon for their plea from the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> of the authority pleaded for: for if it be a <hi>National Church</hi> that requires the ſaid obedience, we ſay, 1. That that <hi>Church</hi> cannot pretend to challenge obedience, that is not capacitated to make or execute any Law; but the <hi>National</hi> is not: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Minor appears, in that there is no ſuch thing as a <hi>National organized Church</hi> conſtituted by Chriſt under the Goſpel; for if there were, there muſt be <hi>National Officers</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> by the ſame appointment: but Chriſt hath conſtituted no National Officers, <hi>i. e.</hi> whoſe Office-power in the Church is of ſuch extent; nor no <hi>National Ordinances,</hi> i. e. ſuch Ordinances that the whole Nation may partake of in one Aſſembly for <hi>communion.</hi> The ſame
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:135610:74"/>Argument will hold againſt <hi>Dioceſan Churches.</hi> 2. How is any one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church <hi>the Church,</hi> more than another that hath ſuch a Ruling power, if all hath it alike? how various will Church-canons be, and how little Uniformity in <hi>canonical obedience?</hi> 3. If this obedience belongs to any Church, it ſeems moſt conſonant to right reaſon that it ſhould belong to the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> for 1. That may be as <hi>organical</hi> as a <hi>National</hi> can be by virtue of any inſtitution of Chriſt. 2. That's moſt <hi>comprehenſive;</hi> therefore challengeth the <hi>preheminence</hi> of all others in reſpect of extent, and by way of eminency may moſt properly be ſtiled <hi>the Church.</hi> 3. This is the likelieſt way to attain a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity;</hi> for it's pleaded as the great reaſon why Chriſt gives a <hi>Legiſlative Compulſive</hi> power to a National Church, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformitatis gratiâ.</hi> Now it's but a partial Uniformity obtained thereby, of an Independent nature; but if true Uniformity be reached, it muſt be that which is <hi>Catholick;</hi> which can be no otherwiſe than by <hi>Catholick canonical obedience.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Of the Impoſition of Ceremonies.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. NExt to the conſideration of <hi>decencies and order,</hi> it may be meet to enquire a little into the lawfulneſs of impoſition 1. of Ceremonies, 2. of a form of Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether a Ceremony uncommanded by God, may be uſed in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God,</hi> is not our preſent Undertaking to diſcuſs; for in ſome caſes it <hi>may be lawful,</hi> ſo it be ſuch as is <hi>duely qualified,</hi> and be uſed as <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>occaſionally,</hi> by the <hi>Rules of diſcretion:</hi> but our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Enquiry ſhall be,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Church is liable to the impoſition of ſuch Ceremonies as Chriſt hath not made neceſſary by any Law of his?</hi> Many Arguments before urged againſt the Churches Legiſlative power, might be here of equal force. I ſhall onely adde ſomething proper upon this ſtate of the Queſtion, to prove that ſuch an impoſition is not in the Churches power.</p>
            <p>§ 2. <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Church by ſuch <hi>impoſition</hi> doth ſubjugate herſelf in her Members to <hi>a yoke of bondage,</hi> which Chriſt hath freed her and them from. That Chriſtians are <hi>freed from ſuch yokes,</hi> ſee
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:135610:74"/>
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.31. <hi>ch.</hi> 5.1. and the Church is not <hi>to return to any bondage</hi> that ſhe is freed from by Chriſt, ſhe being not a competent Judge of her own bondage or freedom. The Church of the Jews were not ſo; for they are condemned by the Spirit of God for not laying aſide that bondage to ceremonies which Chriſt would have eaſed them of. Hence in judgment her <hi>Ear is bored,</hi> and ſhe is become a profeſſed Vaſſal thereto, until the time of the fulneſs of the Gentiles; and would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it her greateſt felicity, might ſhe but have opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the full enjoyment and exerciſe of the old <hi>obſolete Rites</hi> of the ceremonial Law. Hence nothing can be a more unqueſtionable truth, than that a <hi>Goſpel-Church</hi> may not return her ſelf or members to a ſubjection to a <hi>ceremonial Yoke:</hi> for, 1. If a Chriſtian or Church may return to <hi>one Yoke</hi> that Chriſt hath redeemed them from, then as well to another; if to that of a <hi>ceremonial Law,</hi> then to that of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works alſo. 2. Again, if they may return to bondage, then they may <hi>ſtay</hi> in bondage as the Jews did: for both ways Chriſt equally <hi>profits them nothing,</hi> as a Redeemer profits not a Slave that will remain a captive, or return into it. 3. There's nothing can be more <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> to a Redeemer, than ſo to overthrow his whole deſigne of redemption.</p>
            <p>§ 3. That Chriſt hath freed his <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as a yoke of bondage, <hi>viz.</hi> from all not inſtituted and ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by himſelf, I thus prove. 1. If Chriſt hath not freed the Church of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> from all ceremonies beſides his own, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Goſpel-church would be much worſe than the <hi>Moſaical,</hi> whoſe bondage was under a Law of ceremonies of God's own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation; and ſure if a Chriſtian muſt be under the <hi>plague of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> it is far better to fall into the hands of God than Man; and the Jewiſh Church muſt needs be more happy than the Chriſtian, who lie at the mercy of mens vain Imaginations and tyrannical Will. It was known to them of the Old Teſtament how great their burden was, though <hi>preſcribed</hi> by God, and <hi>circumſcribed</hi> exactly as to the latitude, and extent, and bulk of them; ſo that they could not eaſily be impoſed upon by man: and yet we ſee they could not eſcape the <hi>Traditions of the Elders,</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious Obſervations of the Phariſees.</hi> But what a miſerable condition are Churches of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in, who are ſo liable to ſo heavie and intolerable a bulk of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, without bounds or meaſure, <hi>arbitrarily</hi> to be increaſed by men of corrupt minds and intereſt, calling themſelves <hi>the Church:</hi> and were there a tythe of the ceremonies in the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> of what is in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:135610:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> which the Papiſts have accumulated upon this ground. And Chriſt hath given leave to the Church under the Goſpel, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and impoſe what ceremonies ſhe in her wiſdom thinks meet? 2. Unleſs Chriſt hath freed the <hi>Goſpel-church</hi> from <hi>ceremonial bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> how is the Goſpel-church the <hi>free Woman?</hi> Was not the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage-ſtate of the Jewiſh Church very much, yea moſt in this reſpect? But is not the Goſpel-church in far greater ſervitude? for the <hi>Jews</hi> were in <hi>bondage to God's ceremonies,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to mans. And if Chriſt allows us not to return to ceremonial bondage of <hi>God's impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> ſure he allows us not a return unto ſuch of mans phanatick deviſing, and mercileſs impoſition. 3. To be in bondage under ceremonies for divine Worſhip, is to be in bondage under the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world;</hi> but the Goſpel-church is delivered by Chriſt from bondage to the <hi>Elements of the world,</hi> Gal. 4.3.9. for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Elements or Principles of the world, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.8. they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, according <hi>to the tradition of men;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. they are thoſe that Chriſt hath redeemed us from, and <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>beggarly,</hi> Gal. 4.9. and if the ceremonies of the Jews, once inſtituted by God himſelf, were ſuch, how much more are the ceremonious Relicts of <hi>heatheniſh Idolatry,</hi> or any other that are products of mens Brains and corrupt Wills? What poor, wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and abominably <hi>beggarly things</hi> are they, for the members of Chriſt to be enſlaved to? What pitiful Ornaments are old rotten Hangings to put up in Chriſt's houſe, that excellent Fabrick of his own building? If they, I ſay, <hi>(Jewiſh)</hi> were <hi>worldly,</hi> much more thoſe which are <hi>originally from the world,</hi> of worldly contrivance and intereſt: for all ſuch muſt be of <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>world;</hi> but they are not from God either <hi>immediately or mediately;</hi> not <hi>immediately,</hi> becauſe not inſtituted by him; not <hi>mediately,</hi> becauſe he never <hi>deputed any</hi> authority to inſtitute them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> of <hi>the world.</hi> Hence the Church and Chriſtians ſhould be <hi>dead with Chriſt, to the Rudiments of the world, and not live in the world ſubject to ſuch Elements,</hi> Col. 2.20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. The ceremonies ſpoken of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. which the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> returned to, were but <hi>humane commandments, though Jewiſh;</hi> for they ceaſed now to be commanded of God, yea, were forbidden by him; and all the <hi>Sanction</hi> which now they had, was <hi>from man:</hi> And the Apoſtle doth convincingly prove the unlawfulneſs of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanction</hi> of Jewiſh ceremonies; by doing of which, he doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently caſt down all humanely-inſtituted ceremonies in divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and by the Prelates practice, many Jewiſh ceremonies, as <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:135610:75"/>Altars, Ephods,</hi> &amp;c. are not onely lawful as things indifferent, but required as things not to be diſpenſed with, therefore neceſſary. 5. Chriſt hath freed his Church and Members from being <hi>ſervants unto men</hi> in the Worſhip of God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> from humane <hi>ceremonial Laws:</hi> That place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. muſt be underſtood of ſervitude unto men, in an Eccleſiaſtical, or at leaſt Religious ſence: for he ſaith, <hi>Let every man abide in the Calling wherein he is called; ſervants in obedience to their Maſters, children to their Parents, ſubjects to their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> &amp;c. For the <hi>Corinths</hi> thought that there was a neceſſity on their converſion to alter their Callings which they had before; as if a man were called, being a <hi>ſervant,</hi> to be a Chriſtian, that thereby he became his brother, and ought not any longer to ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. But the Apoſtle clears up this doubt, and ſaith, Thou being a <hi>ſervant,</hi> do not think thy relation to thy Maſter is diſſolved ever the more becauſe of thy converſion; thou art as much a ſervant as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and therefore he ſaith, being called, do not preſently renounce thy <hi>relation,</hi> and refuſe ſubjection to thy Maſter, upon pretence that thou art Chriſt's freeman, but abide in the place of a ſervant as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; thou art nevertheleſs God's <hi>freeman,</hi> thy <hi>Conſcience free</hi> for God's Worſhip, to ſerve him according to his revealed Will: and therefore in this kind be not a ſervant to men, or any ſort of men; though thou mayſt lawfully remain a <hi>Family-ſervant,</hi> yet be not a <hi>Conſcience-vaſſal</hi> unto any men.</p>
            <p>§ 4. <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If it be lawful for the Church or other power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and impoſe <hi>Laws for Ceremonies,</hi> whereby Churches and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are liable to ſuch Laws, then it's lawful to erect a <hi>ceremonial Law</hi> under the Goſpel: for what is a Law of, or for a <hi>body of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> but a <hi>ceremonial Law?</hi> But Chriſt would never pull down one <hi>ceremonial Law</hi> by his death, for man to erect another; and pull down one <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and leave it lawful for man to erect one more <hi>heatheniſh;</hi> would he aboliſh one ceremonial Law of <hi>divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> and leave it to man to eſtabliſh a new one of his <hi>own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;</hi> yea, a thouſand <hi>ceremonial Laws</hi> of as many ſorts as there are ſeveral Churches and Ages in the world? It's a moſt abſurd and untheological conceit, that a <hi>ceremonial Law</hi> is conſiſtent with the ſtate of the Goſpel, wherein all Vails whatever is removed from the Lord Jeſus, beſides <hi>the vail of his fleſh;</hi> neither is the <hi>Spirituality</hi> of his Ordinances to be clogged with ſuch a bulkie maſs of <hi>fleſhly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 5. <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If we be not liable to an <hi>impoſition and enforcement</hi> of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:135610:76"/>Chriſt's own by a temporal <hi>Penal Law,</hi> much leſs liable to ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ceremonies by Eccleſiaſtick or other authority; for all impoſition is by a <hi>Penal Law:</hi> but we know Chriſt never made any <hi>Penal Law</hi> to be Eccleſiaſtically adminiſtred, thereby to enforce men to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>receive the Supper:</hi> His people that ſubmit to his Ordinances, muſt <hi>be willing</hi> and free: whereunto they are brought by enlightning the Underſtanding, and perſwading the Will, as the great end of the Goſpel preached. Thoſe that will ſay otherwiſe, muſt juſtifie the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> in bringing the poor <hi>Indians</hi> to their baptiſm by force. The claim that any make to the uſe of the Magiſtrates Sword, or force of Arms, to prevail with men to ſubmit to any things pretended to be ſpiritual, is of like nature, and will fall under the like condemnation: And how much worſe by the Rule of Proportion muſt that needs be, to <hi>enforce</hi> ceremonies of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inſtitution, than thoſe of divine? Would not Chriſt give ſuch a power to the Church to enjoyn his own inſtitution under <hi>Corporal or Penal Mulcts?</hi> how much leſs will he bear ſo great an uſurpation for any to erect a body of ceremonial Laws, with <hi>Penalties</hi> annexed, thereby to enforce them on the Conſciences and practices of others? The Argument ſtands very fair and forcing, from the greater to the leſs: That power that cannot juſtifie the impoſing any of Chriſt's <hi>own Ordinances</hi> on men, even on unregenerate, and no viſible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, cannot juſtifie the impoſing humane Ordinances on the <hi>viſible Members</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt; but no Power can juſtifie the <hi>impoſing</hi> any of Chriſt's Inſtitutions by a Penal Law, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> there is none can pretend to defend any ſuch proceedings, by any plauſible Argument from Scripture or right Reaſon.</p>
            <p>§ 6. <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If the Church is liable to the <hi>impoſition of Ceremonies</hi> not inſtituted by Chriſt, it's either to the impoſition of <hi>inſignificant,</hi> or of <hi>ſignificant.</hi> It's not ſubjected to the impoſition of <hi>inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,</hi> i. e. of childiſh or irrational empty ceremonies of no ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for this were to mock God, and imitate the Heathens in a groſs manner, to uſe <hi>antick geſtures and actions</hi> (in God's ſolemn Worſhip) of which there can be no plauſible reaſon pretended; therefore ſuch things are <hi>abſolutely vain</hi> and <hi>unlawful.</hi> 2. For <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Ceremonies,</hi> Church-powers cannot impoſe them, 1. Becauſe none may deviſe and enact ſuch into a Law at pleaſure. 2. None can pretend ſufficiently to the ſigne and thing neceſſarily requiring <hi>ſignification</hi> thereby in Chriſt's Worſhip, but Chriſt himſelf. A ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy in <hi>divine ſervice,</hi> muſt be ſuch as Chriſt would have, &amp; no other;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:135610:76"/>he will not have ſuch things ſignified as are <hi>heterogenious</hi> to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: and <hi>homogenious</hi> things onely may be repreſented by <hi>homogenious</hi> ſignes; and who can determine ſuch, but the moſt wiſe Legiſlator and King of his Church? 3. <hi>Significant Ceremonies</hi> are ſo by virtue of <hi>adaptation</hi> of a ſigne by ſome Law to the <hi>thing ſignified,</hi> and they are either Moral or Inſtituted: Moral and natural are ſuch wherein there is a natural or moral relation between the ſigne and thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, or at leaſt acquired by uſe and cuſtom, as bowing the body, and uncovering the head, of reverence and ſubjection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there is nothing in this kind neceſſary to be done in the Worſhip of God, which is not already done: for if Chriſt had ſeen a neceſſity of any more ceremonies of that kind, he would have annexed them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ceremonies of <hi>limited Inſtitution</hi> are not to be impoſed; for ſuch are either <hi>Typical</hi> or <hi>Sacramental.</hi> 1. There can be no <hi>Typical Ceremonies</hi> under the New Teſtament, becauſe the Body is come, and the Shadows muſt flie away. 2. Nor can there be any <hi>Sacramental Ceremonies</hi> inſtituted: for herein lies the exerciſe of Chriſt's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, to inſtitute Sacraments; neither doth he enforce the uſe of any by <hi>corporal or pecuniary Penal Laws</hi> 3. A Sacrament (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Church of <hi>England</hi>) is a <hi>viſible ſigne of an inviſible Grace;</hi> in which ſence all ſignificant ceremonies ſhould be <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as the Surplice <hi>a ſigne of inward Purity;</hi> but they that have not power to give the <hi>thing ſignified</hi> as well as the <hi>ſigne,</hi> have no power to make a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> which Chriſt does in all his. 4. A Sacrament is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>ſignificant ſign</hi> in divine things, but ſuch a ceremony as is a fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſigne and ſeal; ſuch was <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>Paſſover of old, Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper under the New Teſtament;</hi> ſuch (though humane Innovatious) is the <hi>Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Ring in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:</hi> for they are conſecrated <hi>Ceremonies, ſignificant,</hi> and <hi>federally obligatory;</hi> which appears by the Churches inſtitution of them. But there may be no <hi>Sacramental</hi> ceremony inſtituted by the Church: this would be a groſs addition to Chriſt's Sacraments annexed to the New Covenant, which muſt not be altered, nor have any new ones ſuperadded: for if any humane power may increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> to three or four, they may go to ſeven with the Papiſts; and why not as well to ſeventy? Thoſe two <hi>additional</hi> which ſome Proteſtant Churches retain, they are beholding to <hi>Rome</hi> for the inſtitution of them. Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and others hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved that no Church can inſtitute ceremonies of Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſignificancy and intent; and therefore I need not enlarge here upon it.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXIII. <hi>Of Obligation to a Form of Prayer.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. HAving diſcuſſed that <hi>Queſtion,</hi> whether a Church or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is liable to <hi>impoſition of Ceremonies,</hi> it remains now to enquire, <hi>How far a Church or Chriſtian may be obliged to a Form of Prayer? A Form of Prayer is ſuch a Prayer as is premeditated and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by our ſelves or others, as to the matter and form of Petitions and Words, conſtantly and unalterably to be uſed on times and occaſions ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the matter, form, and drift of the ſaid Prayer.</hi> The Queſtion here will not be, <hi>Whether a Chriſtian may not uſe a Form of Prayer;</hi> but, <hi>Whether it be lawful for a Chriſtian (as much as to uſe any indifferency) to binde himſelf, or ſuffer himſelf to be obliged to a preſcribed Form of Prayer?</hi> which Enquiry falls into two parts. 1. <hi>Whether a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may come under an obligation, by vow or reſolution, to uſe a Set-form of Prayer, as before explained?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether he may ſuffer himſelf to come under any ſuch obligation by virtue of a Law made by any preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Authority thereunto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. As to the firſt, we ſhall aſſert and confirm the Negative, That <hi>it's not lawful for a Chriſtian to put himſelf under any ſuch obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his own Vow or Covenant,</hi> or I may adde, by his cuſtomary and conſtant abiding therein; which doth in effect amount to a Covenant-tye. If ſuch a Tye were lawful, it's either as a thing <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> or <hi>indifferent;</hi> for all lawful things are ſo. 1. It's not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as a thing <hi>neceſſary</hi> (will be eaſily granted) becauſe none will ſay, that are Proteſtants, that a Chriſtian is <hi>neceſſarily</hi> bound to a Form of Prayer by the poſitive command of Chriſt; if they do, let it be ſhewn where Chriſt doth require any ſo to oblige himſelf, or condemn any for not doing it; or let him alleadge any Scriptural Example where any hath done it, eſpecially in the New Teſtament. I ſuppoſe we need not ſtay on that part. The ſecond part of the Disjunction, that it's not lawful for him, as an indifferency, to binde up himſelf to <hi>ſuch a Form,</hi> I prove thus: All Chriſtian indifferent actions of concern in the Worſhip of Chriſt, ought to be determined by the judgment <hi>of diſcretion,</hi> according to the Goſpel-rules of <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency, pro hic &amp; nunc;</hi> but to lay ones ſelf under ſuch an Obligation,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:135610:77"/>would hinder him from walking by ſuch Rules, and by ſuch a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Ergo,</hi> to uſe it as an Indifferency, and to come under ſuch an Obligation, are moſt <hi>inconſiſtent;</hi> but if it be ſaid that it's expedient for him to come under ſuch an Obligation, the <hi>ratio formalis</hi> muſt be becauſe he cannot compoſe another Prayer, or pray by preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: But that is not a <hi>juſtifiable reaſon;</hi> for though he cannot at preſent, he may afterwards be able ſo to do. It's juſt as if a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lame and uſeth crutches, makes a vow never to go without them, though he ſhall be never ſo well. Or it may be another Form may be offered more ſuitable to his condition (we meeting with dayly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations on that account;) it's not fit therefore that we ſhould be bound up always to the ſame Expreſſions, Petitions, Confeſſions, and Thankſgivings; our <hi>Neceſſities, Temptations, Sins, and Mercies received, dayly changing.</hi> Beſides, though a man have not at preſent the gift of Prayer, or aſſiſtance of the Spirit thereunto, yet he ought to <hi>ſeek and wait</hi> for it; and therefore ought not to binde himſelf up to ſuch a Form, though he may <hi>uſe it for preſent neceſſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. It's not an indifferent thing for any man <hi>to ſtint</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Religion where God hath not <hi>ſtinted him:</hi> Where Chriſt hath allotted to us a <hi>Freedom,</hi> the contrary to it is <hi>Bondage;</hi> and no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to put himſelf into bondage where Chriſt hath made him free. Whereas ſtinted Forms bound to, brings a man into Bondage to Words, or theſe and thoſe <hi>Petitions, Confeſſions,</hi> &amp;c. which though it may be ſuitable for one ſtate and ſeaſon, may not be at another, neither ſo much to Chriſt's glory, and his own edification: for Chriſt hath foreſeen a <hi>neceſſity of freedom</hi> in this kind, as to the uſe of <hi>words and ſentences</hi> in Prayer, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be regulated by Goſpel-rules of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency, as all Chriſtian liberty is. 1. Becauſe of the various Caſes, Occurrences, and Exigences that a Chriſtian is liable to, that it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible any one can ſuit <hi>fore-preſcribed</hi> Forms unto them; and we are enjoyned in <hi>all things to make our Requeſts known unto God.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the divers helps and aſſiſtances of the Spirit in expreſſion of our wants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. even ſometimes in <hi>Sighs and Groans,</hi> unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in words, and unreducible into any Forms; yea, often not knowable before we come to ask, becauſe diſcovered to us by the Spirit, ſearching our hearts while we are waiting upon God in the duty. 3. Becauſe of the divers frame of a Chriſtians own ſpirit that he is ſubject unto, ſometimes of deadneſs and deſpondency, ſometimes of enlargement (that for the moſt times thoſe are ſtrangers to, who keep up in the road of words) that the ſame words and ſentences
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:135610:78"/>cannot in Faith be uttered, without the ſameneſs of heart-frame, which cannot always be; which they abundantly know, <hi>who have their ſenſes exerciſed by reaſon of uſe.</hi> There are the frequent ebbings and flowings of particular Graces in a Chriſtian's heart, as of <hi>Faith, Repentance, Joy, Patience,</hi> &amp;c. according to which he is always to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> his expreſſions in Prayer as neer as may be, in order to his own comfort, and power againſt prevailing corruptions. Beſides, I might inſtance in the various aſſaults Satan makes upon us, his manifold wiles, as alſo the divers workings of our hearts towards or againſt corruption; as laſtly, the various and unexpected Mercies that we be daily partakers of. Examples we have many in Scripture of ſuiting Prayers in this manner, if we conſider how it was with the Saints of old, as <hi>David, Heman, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. 4. Becauſe Chriſt hath onely given us <hi>general Rules</hi> in the Goſpel for particular Prayers, and hath not bound or limited us to <hi>any particular Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. <hi>Obj.</hi> But Chriſt hath preſcribed us a <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> viz. that commonly called the Lord's Prayer; for he ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. <hi>When you pray, ſay,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's moſt abſurd to think that Chriſt bound his Diſciples to thoſe <hi>words and ſentences,</hi> and bound us up from all others; and one Scripture muſt explain another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. it's after this manner, <hi>i.e.</hi> for ſence and meaning. 2. If <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. were to be underſtood ſtrictly, then we muſt neither adde to or diminiſh from, nor alter the Form. Hence it were unlawful to uſe the <hi>Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> mentioned <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 3. If it were ſo, Chriſt's Diſciples (this Prayer being <hi>primarily</hi> directed to them upon their requeſt) ſhould never have uſed any other Prayer; but we finde not that they ever uſed the very <hi>Prayer in identity</hi> of words and ſentences. 4. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their requeſt, it was moſt probable to be a Rule for <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Method;</hi> for they deſired our Saviour to <hi>teach them to pray as</hi> John <hi>taught his Diſciples.</hi> Now we finde not any preſcribed Form left by <hi>John</hi> to his, neither I ſuppoſe did our Saviour in this leave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than a <hi>Pattern or a ſtanding Rule</hi> of Prayer to his people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. 5. He never uſed it himſelf, becauſe he had no ſin, need not ſay, <hi>Forgive me my ſins.</hi> 6. All expreſſions are in the <hi>plural number,</hi> ſhewing that we have onely the moſt general Rules; ſecret Prayer, is to be referred to it, and particular caſes, but not here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in words and ſyllables. 7. If Chriſt had bound us to this Form, then we were to uſe no other; neither might the <hi>Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe</hi> any other; neither might <hi>particular Chriſtians</hi> uſe their gifts in Prayer, nor various Forms of their own or others preſcription: which would be too groſly abſurd for any to aſſert.</p>
            <pb n="147" facs="tcp:135610:78"/>
            <p>§ 5. But <hi>fifthly,</hi> to infer that Chriſt (by preſcribing this Form as <hi>imitable</hi> by us, or by propounding and commending this to us as a Rule or Form) did thereby tye us up to other Forms, or gave pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Church to binde us to Forms, or that we might binde our ſelves to other Forms, is as great an inconſequence as any in the world; for we have ſhewed there's more reaſon to judge that he left it as a <hi>Rule than Form:</hi> If he left it as a <hi>Form,</hi> it's no ground for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men to make Forms, but rather a ground to the contrary, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Prerogative as our Lord and Maſter. And beſides, if he hath given us a <hi>Form,</hi> and we are thereby bound to words and ſentences, we ought not to take up other <hi>Forms,</hi> and multiply <hi>thouſands</hi> of mens preſcriptions; for the ſence of Chriſt muſt needs be one of theſe two, when you pray, ſay, <hi>i. e.</hi> uſe this as the onely Form of Prayer, and ſtick to it for words and ſentences, and never trouble your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any other: for if it be taken in the other ſence, it's <hi>univerſal.</hi> Take this as a ſtanding general rule of Prayer, to which all ſorts of Petitions, Deprecations, Confeſſions, Thankſgivings, are referrable. If he had authorized any to compoſe other teaching Forms, he would have ſaid, You, Apoſtles and your Succeſſors, thou Catholick Church, or National Church, or particular Congregation; do you compoſe a Form of divine Service, and I will ſet my hand to it.</p>
            <p>§ 6. The <hi>ſecond part of the Queſtion</hi> is, <hi>Whether a Chriſtian may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to be bound to a Form of Prayer by humane Authority preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto?</hi> The Anſwer to this Enquiry will be double: 1. That whatever Authority, Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, doth pretend to ſuch an impoſing power, a Chriſtian is not to <hi>ſubject</hi> himſelf by active <hi>ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> 2. That no powers beneath Chriſt, can pretend juſtly <hi>to ſuch Authority.</hi> The reaſons of the firſt hath been largely enough inſiſted on before; therefore I ſhall here but touch upon them. 1. Becauſe Chriſt hath not left it indifferent to a Chriſtian <hi>to be bound</hi> in matters of his Worſhip, where he hath left him <hi>at liberty;</hi> for thereby the uſe of diſcretion, in conveniencies, is loſt. 2. All thoſe reaſons why he may not binde himſelf to a Form of Prayer, do <hi>formally prove</hi> that he is not to permit himſelf to be impoſed upon in this kind by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 3. None but Chriſt may preſcribe Set-forms of his own Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and we are not allowed <hi>obedientially</hi> to ſubmit to any Legiſlative power in this kind, as hath been ſhewed. 4. If a Chriſtian ſuffer himſelf in this to be <hi>impoſed upon,</hi> he parts with one of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent priviledges that he is capable of, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>ſpeaking his minde to God in Prayer,</hi> and not to be bound to the Dictates and Suggeſtions of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:135610:79"/>another. Who can know our own caſe in reſpect of Sins, Wants, Temptations, Mercies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> better than our ſelves? What is more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, than that a Childe (though he cannot ſpeak plainly) ſhould not be ſuffered to ſpeak his mind to his Parents, as well as he can, but muſt be always preſcribed to it in the Servants or elder Brothers words and expreſſions? To deal thus with God's Children, is to go about to abandon the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> which God's Children are led by, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2.14, 15. which Spirit they have for this end, that they cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> that they may ſpeak the language of the Spirit in Prayer (though their utterance be in broken and abrupt Sentences, even in <hi>ſighs and groans</hi>) which God knows the meaning of. Wherefore to put our ſelves under humane ſet Forms, is to put ourſelves into the greateſt ſpiritual Bondage of this nature.</p>
            <p>§. 7. Secondly, <hi>No Power Eccleſiaſtical or Civil can pretend juſtly to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Chriſt, to impoſe on Miniſter or Chriſtian a ſet Form of Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If any can pretend to ſuch Authority, it muſt be to <hi>impoſe a ſet Form of Chriſts compoſing,</hi> or <hi>of humane compoſition:</hi> But they cannot pretend juſtly to impoſe any Prayer of <hi>Chriſts compoſing,</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath neither required nor allowed the impoſing the uſe of that which is called <hi>the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer by penal Laws. What corporal or pecuniary Mulcts</hi> are to be inflicted on a man that doth not uſe the very words of that Prayer, by virtue of any Law of Chriſt? Is he to be Whipped, or Fined for it by the Magiſtrate, or Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Church? Again, they cannot pretend to impoſe a Form of <hi>humane compoſition;</hi> for if there be no ground to impoſe a Form of Prayer of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>compoſition,</hi> by a penal Law, much leſs to impoſe one of Mans: And for any to undertake, either Church or State, to preſcribe the worſhip of Chriſt, and to enforce it by puniſhments, where Chriſt never deputed or allowed ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is the greateſt preſumption and inſolency in the world.</p>
            <p>§. 8. <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. He or they that impoſe a Form of Prayer, muſt do it, becauſe it is <hi>neceſſarily or indifferently requiſite</hi> ſo to do, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the revealed Will of Chriſt: But none can impoſe a Form of Prayer for any of theſe reaſons. <hi>Ergo.</hi> 1. None can, becauſe a Form of Prayer is <hi>neceſſarity requiſite,</hi> 1. Becauſe Chriſt hath no where <hi>required</hi> the Church or Magiſtrate to impoſe. 2. If a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Prayer were abſolutely neceſſary, it could not be to any perſon or ſeaſon <hi>diſpenſed</hi> with. 3. If the neceſſity be pleaded for <hi>publick Prayers,</hi> that there ſhould be <hi>a ſet Form,</hi> there is as little ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of that, can be proved from the Word of God, as of private
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:135610:79"/>Set-Forms. 4. If there be need of a Form for help in ſome caſes, in reſpect of preſent weakneſs of Miniſters or Chriſtians, it's no reaſon therefore it ſhould be impoſed as neceſſary to all it's pleaded for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Uniformity; but if ſome of his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects wear Spectacles, becauſe of the weakneſs of their Eyes, muſt all do ſo too for Uniformity ſake, though their Eyes be never ſo good? We are to ſtrive after perfection and conformity to Chriſt therein, but are not to endeavour to conform to the <hi>weakneſſes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> of his Members, and take our meaſures thereby; though we are to bear with and condeſcend to them as much as may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin.</p>
            <p>§ 9. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Form of Prayer cannot be impoſed as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently requiſite to the worſhip of Chriſt; becauſe 1. If any thing be indifferently (<hi>i. e.</hi> conveniently) requiſite to the worſhip of Chriſt, it is becauſe Chriſt hath willed it indifferently requiſite: for all matters of his Worſhip take their firſt reaſon from <hi>his Will.</hi> 2. There is no reaſon from the <hi>indifferency</hi> of any thing, to impoſe it as <hi>neceſſary:</hi> But in Spiritual concerns the <hi>indifferency</hi> of any thing is a reaſon againſt the impoſition of it <hi>as neceſſary;</hi> becauſe ſuch an impoſition takes away the Formal uſe as <hi>an indifferency,</hi> 3. What Chriſt hath revealed as <hi>indifferently requiſite,</hi> he hath required a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to uſe <hi>indifferently</hi> by the judgment of <hi>diſcretion;</hi> for every action concerning Chriſt's worſhip, is to be performed as Chriſt hath preſcribed the nature of it; neceſſary things to be done <hi>neceſſarily</hi> by us, (but not to be impoſed on us) and <hi>indifferent things indifferently.</hi> Therefore an Impoſition to enforce the uſe of <hi>indifferent things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary indifferently, is unlawful,</hi> as contrary to the Will of Chriſt. 4. We have before proved, that neither Church nor State can change an Evangelical Indifferency in the Worſhip of Chriſt into a Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>§ 10. <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. To exerciſe <hi>Dominion over Mens Faith,</hi> is unlawful: but for Church or Magiſtrate to impoſe a ſet Form of Prayer, is to <hi>exerciſe Dominion over Mens Faith, Ergo.</hi> The Major is without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to exerciſe ſuch a Dominion, is to preſcribe what we ſhall <hi>believe and practice,</hi> or to enforce us to <hi>practice in Sacred things without believing.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is true, becauſe there can be no greater <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Dominion</hi> over Faith, than in impoſing on us a Form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for every Prayer is to be <hi>prayed in Faith,</hi> or elſe it is ſin. Now to impoſe a Form on me, (being to enforce me to that Prayer that I be not ſatisfied in) is to impoſe <hi>on my Faith,</hi> i.e. to preſcribe what
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:135610:80"/>I ſhould believe for practice in Prayer; or to enforce me to <hi>practice</hi> that which I do <hi>not believe;</hi> i. e. to pray that Prayer, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, in ſuch a part of Worſhip which I cannot do believingly.</p>
            <p>§ 11. <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If one Church may <hi>enforce</hi> a Form of Prayer by <hi>a Penal Law,</hi> then another may; <hi>i. e.</hi> if a <hi>National Church</hi> may enforce a Form of Prayer on all her <hi>Subordinate Churches</hi> and Members, then <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal viſible Church</hi> may <hi>on the National</hi> which are her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and if the <hi>National</hi> can puniſh the <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> or <hi>Parochial,</hi> for Non-conformity in this kind, why may not the <hi>Catholick</hi> puniſh the <hi>National</hi> for the ſame fault? <hi>i. e.</hi> for uſing a Form of Prayer not ſufficiently allowed or preſcribed by the <hi>Catholick:</hi> and if the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal can interdict an <hi>inferiour Church,</hi> or <hi>Excommunicate a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> for refuſal of ſuch Obedience, why may not the <hi>Catholick</hi> deal with the <hi>National</hi> in the ſame kind? This muſt needs be conceded, but that it will be ſaid, we do not know Where to find the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and though the Church of <hi>Rome calls herſelf ſo,</hi> yet ſhe is not to be believed; ſhe bears <hi>witneſs of herſelf, and that witneſs is not true.</hi> I only reply, We can as eaſily, and more, find the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as <hi>a National;</hi> for there hath been always a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but there never hath been, nor will be, a <hi>National Goſpel organized Church</hi> in the world. And we may as well believe a pretending Church calling herſelf <hi>Catholick,</hi> as a pretending Church calling her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>National;</hi> when as they are equally to be accounted as no Churches of Chriſts Ordination, as I can eaſily manifeſt when time ſhall ſerve. Well then, the National Church lyes liable to the cenſure of the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> for uſing a diſtinct ſet Form of publick Prayers eſtabliſhed by her ſelf, whereby ſhe renders herſelf a groſs <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt</hi> to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and an <hi>Independent</hi> in reſpect of all other <hi>National,</hi> her Form of Prayer being not Uniform with theirs. If it be ſaid the Church may <hi>compoſe</hi> and <hi>impoſe</hi> a Form of Prayer, we muſt know <hi>what Church</hi> that is, and not be deluded with <hi>a Name.</hi> Is it the <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> if ſo, why have we not a <hi>Catholick ſet Form of publick Prayers,</hi> and all National Churches bound to the uſe of it? And why, on the contrary, doth every <hi>National Church</hi> make and uſe Forms of their own? And if it be ſaid, The <hi>National</hi> is the Church, it's falſe; for it's not the Church by way of Eminency, it's not the moſt <hi>Generical</hi> Church, becauſe it's not the only Church, there are many <hi>National,</hi> and there are many other ſort of Churches, that will put in for as good a right as the <hi>National:</hi> and if every <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> under the Name of the Church may do this, and have a diſtinct
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:135610:80"/>Form of Prayer, what will become of <hi>Catholick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity?</hi> And if the Church as <hi>Provincial</hi> or <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> what will become of <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity?</hi> And if this power be granted to any, or all theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Churches, <hi>Actum erit de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformitate Catholicâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 12. But the great plea for a <hi>Form</hi> of Prayer in the Church, is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> for this cannot be (ſay ſome Men) without it. <hi>Anſw.</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity in the Church cannot be by particular <hi>National Forms,</hi> it muſt be by a <hi>Form Catholick.</hi> 2. Can there be no <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in the Church without a <hi>ſameneſs</hi> in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Sentences</hi> in prayer, there ſcarcely being two Scripture-Prayers that are altogether the ſame in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Sentences?</hi> Doth not Uniformity conſiſt rather in agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Principles,</hi> and the <hi>Analogie of Faith, ſubmiſſion to, and cloſing with the ſame King, Prieſt and Prophet, conforming to, and walking by the ſame rule of the Goſpel, an influence and guidance by the ſame Spirit?</hi> 3. If Uniformity of the Church lyeth in ſuch <hi>Externals,</hi> why is not a ſet Form of <hi>Preaching</hi> eſtabliſhed, that none ſhall uſe any other beſides ſuch <hi>Homilies?</hi> 4. If a ſet Form of ſome Prayers be neceſſary to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity,</hi> why not of all, as well of private as publick? for if the Church be not cloſe tyed in bond of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> by uniting Families and Individuals, it will break to pieces for all a <hi>publick Form.</hi> The firſt and main Union in the Church, is that which knits every <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Member</hi> to the whole <hi>by joynts and bonds;</hi> and that there may be true Uniformity, this muſt be carefully maintained, but it's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>§ 13. Another great plea for publick Forms of Prayer, is, <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

But there is not the ſame reaſon now the Church is better provided with able Labourers; or at leaſt might be, if ſhe would. 2. It is the ready way to fill the Church with this ſort of Cattle, <hi>thoſe lazy, ignorant, ſcandalous Prieſts,</hi> for Mother-Church not only to connive at them, but to countenance them, and maintain them in their <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ſloth,</hi> and by making their Exerciſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The only way <hi>(Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum fucos pecus a praecipibus arcent)</hi> is to baniſh theſe <hi>droans</hi> from the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:135610:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>Church, and not to turn all the Church unto <hi>droans;</hi> and nothing ſtarves them ſooner, than to leave them to their own ſtock for <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Preaching;</hi> and it's beſt that their Ignorance be bewrayed, that they may be aſhamed, and get better inſtruction and exerciſe in Spiritual things, which are to be guides to other Mens Souls; or if they be not aſhamed, the people may have a full knowledge of them, and be wiſer than to entruſt their Souls in their hands. Therefore it's good that the Props be taken away, and it will ſoon appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch pretended Church-pillars be ſound or rotten.</p>
            <p>§ 14. What is alleadged about Miniſters <hi>abuſe of parts</hi> in publick Prayers, <hi>or want of ſufficiency,</hi> is no forcing Argument for impoſing a Form; for the abuſe of good things, is no argument againſt the uſe; we may as well ſay, Becauſe ſome will be Drunk, therefore none muſt drink Wine or Beer. 2. Inſufficient Miniſters are to be <hi>removed,</hi> or <hi>further inſtructed,</hi> if they be capable and willing, as <hi>Apollo</hi> was. 3. Are not Church-Prayers lyable alſo to abuſe, when uſed by ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Prieſts, in a <hi>formal, cuſtomary, ſlovingly, and prophane <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
